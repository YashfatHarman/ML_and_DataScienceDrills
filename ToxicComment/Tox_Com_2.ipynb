      "000  the one where you add and sometimes unfortunately you drift into pure editorializing this needs some other formulation that isn t a pure projection of your opinion and or personal experiences i happen to be a champion within the waldorf movement of revising the emphasis on the eight year class teacher period but the opposite of brochure speak is antagonist speak both may make statements that appear clear objective and meaningful to the person making them but are too broad and too vague simultaneously it is weasel language unattributed both unprovable and undisprovable the percentage of teachers who make it through 8 years with a single class is staggeringly low so what starts as a lofty goal often ends up as an interruption of the children s education and often under difficult circumstances making the claim that a teacher stays with the class for 8 years is brochure speech not supported by reality it s like saying it is the intention of each baseball player to bat 1000 it is meaningless except for the purpose of sucking people into a set of ideals that aren t part of reality if you don t like the statement that points out the reality of the situation then we should remove the claim completely the wholesale removal of the section on rhythm in the kindergarten it needed revision but not removal i would replace it with something like waldorf early childhood pedagogy believes that clear daily and weekly rhythms are essential for the child s healthy development and emotional security citation reference to the elements of this rhythm it also believes that both the seasons and festivals relating to the course of the year provide central formative experiences citation this is a huge part of waldorf s approach to early childhood education and needs mention i don t disagree that this is part of the pedagogy but the wording has to be concise essential for the child s healthy development and emotional security you sound like donald rumsfeld with your terrorist scare tactics here yes let s all just scare the parents into waldorf education how about just saying rhythms during the day and through the year are thought to be important what you wrote above is the type of brochure speech that riddles this article and makes it impossible to view it as other than a advertisement others of your edits i have already revised and a middle ground has been found this process will continue i would expect i have not been reverting your edits generally only blatant editorializing which i have sometimes managed to convert into something meaningful your middle ground and mine are in very different places my friend blatant editorializing is what my edits have been removing just because i haven t had time to go back and re word what you believe you have made meaningful doesn t mean it has any validity in this article as long as you a waldorf teacher is here making this article meaningful there will be no end to the controversy here the tag should go because it is presently unjustified as you all agree it is inaccurate in its present form why are you advocating keeping something that is not accurate if it becomes accurate it should go back that s easy enough to do nobody agrees as far as i know with what you have said above although one polemic editor besides yourself did remove the tag the tag is completely justified here s the next paragraph that needs brochure speech removed according to steiner the child at this early stage learns through imitation and example 4 so in waldorf it is considered best to surround him with the goodness of the world and caring practically active adults to emulate the curriculum attempts to awaken the child s will and initiative the teacher has the responsibility for providing an environment that stimulates imitation in waldorf such an environment is believed to support the physical and spiritual growth of the child formal learning is absent and experiences of the written language are consciously avoided oral language development is addressed through circle games songs poems and games in movement daily story time normally recited from memory and the range of practical activities and there are more and more similar paragraphs that require lots of work i m sorry if it is offensive to you as a waldorf teacher to find out that lots and lots of people besides you feel it is best to surround children with goodness in fact maybe you should point out schools who as their goal consider it best to surround children with something other than goodness there is absolutely no justification for removing the tag while this type of language fills the article there was at one time a promise of a re write of the article most of which i belie\n",

      "000  hi again i really think the solar sail people are a bit optimistic about its use for interstellar travel the reason is just that as the acceleration is slow you have to wait a long time and travel a long way to reach high speed at a uniform acceleration a you reach velocity v after traveling a distance s according to v sqrt 2as in newtonian approximation which is applicable at the speeds we could hope to reach then s v2 2a and for a given v s gets very large if a is small but since the intensity of sunlight decreases like 1 s2 with distance from the sun a does not remain constant but drops rapidly making things very much worse once you get out to well beyond the orbit of pluto where the sun begins to look like a very bright star the photon drag of the light of other stars begins to become significant as well as the cosmic background radiation which has an energy density comparable to that of starlight finally there is the problem that at really high speeds the light of the sun would begin to be red shifted so you lose power from that effect too some of these problems can be solved by beaming light or microwaves out to the ship with a huge power station a trillion watts say near the earth and a large aperture mirror to focus the beam on the ship then as long as you can maintain the focal spot as small as the ship s sail you could get constant acceleration a calculation i did years ago which i will not try to reproduce now suggested to me that speeds of maybe 0 1c could conceivably be reached in this manner which is very exciting but then somehow you have to stop for example if i recall if the aperture of the beaming mirror is r the ship sail dia r the distance from the sun d and the wavelength then you need r r d and acceleration 10 3g will get you to 0 03c in 30 years at a distance d of 0 5 light years 1018 2 cm which makes the mirror r 50 km in diameter for a sail r 100 km with a 1 um nb the mirror needs to be optically perfect to but the sail does not of course 0 1c is a useful speed and you might split the problem between a beamed laser sailer with a fusion rocket to stop but the trillion watt figure i remember was for a fairly small ship 100 or 1000 tons if i recall and i think a nuclear electric ship capable of reaching even a few percent of c is going to be much larger than that for a payload of 100 or 1000 tons i cannot imagine a decade ship smaller than an aircraft carrier so it sounds like a pretty tough way to go though possibly competitive with other approaches what i personally think we need to do is work the problem modestly hard from an engineering standpoint considering all approaches producing realistic design mission studies that give us the best trade off solution with current technology right now the trip time for a program we could realistically sell to the combined economies of the planet would probably last a thousand years or more so in ten or thirty years we should redo the study and see how that number has changed due to technological advances at some point the curve of reasonable trip times will either get down to the order of the time between studies or else it will flatten out when we hit the wall of feasible engineering or maybe there will be a huge breakthrough when somebody figures out how to create a wormhole to a nearby star or something equally revolutionary anyhow only when the trip time is getting down to the time between studies which would depend on the rate of technology change would it be sensible to start a serious program with what nasa would call a phase a study leading to a program start then a preliminary design review and then a critical design review which is when you can start cutting metal solar sailing is probably a competitive way of getting around the solar system though i think nuclear electric ion drives are likely to prove better the latter can certainly take us all over the solar system in the time scales of the great explorations of the 15th and 16th centuries then in 500 years the solar system will be ours and we will have a far better idea of exactly what is out there in the dark between the stars possibly mini solar systems like jupiter its moons if such systems are common we might find useful places to go only 1 as far as alpha centauri which would change everything and the human species would be safe at last from the many disasters which threaten us now sorry i have been inattentive to wikipedia for a month or two due to other responsibilities which may increase or diminish in\n",

      "000 context of the women s health movement i think it is important to note the context of which carol downer figured out how to do vaginal self exam and menstrual extraction during the woman s health movement at this time the early 1970 s abortion birth control and fertility information were not available to women in addition there were an estimated 5000 deaths a year from illegal abortion this concept helped put reproduction and the woman s body back into the hands of the woman in a safe way i also feel as though some of the language used in this article has a negative connotation for example when it is stated that she promoted a procedure called menstrual extraction if she were pregnant this would constitute a non professional abortion it sounds as if the article is trying to claim that she promoted abortions which isn t necessarily true what she did promote was women reclaiming their bodies and taking them out of the hands of the male dominated medical world and into their own she provided women with means to learn about their bodies at a time where birth control did not exist i also think it should be noted that after roe v wade she traveled to europe canada new zealand and mexico to name a few and attended national and international conferences as advocates of women s health rights in addition i think it should be specified what the roe v wade decision entailed and how it made abortion legalized so she was therefore able to establish the women run clinics roe v wade has a wikipedia article and can be linked these contributions are important because the context all of this was a very important time in women s health history mentioning the context of the women s health movement and how she was providing women with the means to take control of their fertility and reproduction when they had no other means to do so and could even face legal persecutions if they did by adding this the article will make more sense especially because it mentions her arrest and things like the roe v wade trial from an es wgs perspective the revolutionary time where woman began to take back the control of their bodies there are many misconceptions around things like abortion even still today woman have been criminalized for performing or having abortions in history and even today and i think it is important to take note of that also carol downer has played such a crucial role in women s health and feminist activism i was surprised at how short her article was i also think that the women s health movement should have it s own article on wikipedia currently there is feminist health centers and women s health and feminist movement \n",

      "000  about draft hi i like your opinion piece draft it s great in providing many quantifications of the promo commercial articles i like how you narrate your wikiproject poland experience and develop from that i like how you call for a major cleanup drive at the end though you ask the readers to go off separately and do a little bit towards solving the problem imo that is not enough and you ve motivated something bigger a big cleanup drive but that should be a lot more maybe you should compare your proposal to the big drive to address un referenced biographies of living people urblp s a problem that was recognized more and more during 2009 and then blew up in controversy in january 2010 i think it was there was one editor deleting them by the hundreds i think which made others mad and wikipedia was hammered in the outside news coverage about some salient bad incidents the problem was addressed by a big drive with one element being wp urblp wikiproject s efforts that i happened to join the drive was well focused because there was a known number 52 000 of unreferenced blps in a category to be addressed although there were new ones coming in and more old ones being discovered of course and that one editor agreed to back off if the number was reduced by half in six months that s my very imperfect understanding of the situation before i joined the drive i participated in worked well i tried to help keep focus on the goal and in several other ways but some others had far more direct impact than i did see wikipedia talk wikiproject unreferenced biographies of living persons archive 2 goal statement every day we could see the current number and it moving or not and some big changes were made to reduce the number of new urblps coming in and some other targeted efforts were tried and some clearly made a difference while others did not overall having the big numeric public goal that we wanted to meet and having immediate feedback gratification in seeing the total category s number change was key it was rewarding and frustrating and a team effort going on etc not just a bunch of people working completely separately in the end the 6 month goal was finally met though it was very close then i and some others dropped out but the overall problem had been somewhat solved and it s been better since and the number was brought all the way down to 0 effectively and is at about 2 000 now i see i m not saying you should talk much or at all about that urblp problem and its drive in your opinion piece but i think your calling for accurate measurement of the current problem by a one month effort to get all of the problematic articles tagged say the same way would be reasonable there would have to be an enforceable rule made up that prevented the paid pr persons from deleting the tags on their articles there was something like that with the urblps i think anyone seen deleting the urblp tag was warned and blocked as disruptive if necessary and then you can call for something aggressive like bringing the real number down to 100 000 tops within a year or whatever your estimating the problem size to be 150 000 is helpful towards setting that up or you could call for something quite different my main reaction anyhow was that i expected at the end for you to call for something big asking people to separately make efforts that would not even be measurable would not be enough imo you ve earned the right to call for a bigger more organized effort also i m not sure spam is the right title you do clarify you don t mean external links spamming but that s what i think of what is the right name for this problem you have the opportunity to name it maybe perhaps some acronym business puff pieces by paid editors probably bppbpep nope the problem is talked about at talk jimbo wales and elsewhere though and there may be a good name for it already hope this helps my two or three cents i ll get to the other thing i owe but probably not until the weekend or next week ncram \n",

      "000  i would hope that you read both the source and my points fully before making your edit and writing your response as i initially said the source is biased it is true they state themselves that their very organisation was set up initially purely to oppose nuclear power let s leave that to one side however we could always come back to it later the crux of my point leaving aside the bias issue is three fold firstly irrespective of your argument that this is presented as a claim the fact remains that the way the claim is presented is illogical there is no fair comparator for the claim that nuclear power is neither efficient nor effective in cutting co2 emissions a fair comparator should be found or some idea of efficiency viz inefficiency should be presented if even from the biased source itself before re inserting this part without it it is on the same level as saying something as intellectually vacant as some people claim that ferraris are not fast machines not exactly the sort of style an encyclopaedia should be aiming for especially on a scientific article would you not agree secondly with respect to your argument the very empirical information the underlying source uses is being mistreated in what amounts to if i may say a misuse of data on a level which is so obvious it it would actually be quite comical if it were where it belonged along with many thousands of other equally lazy special interest group papers it is a self contradicting source here s why it makes its supposition that nuclear power is inefficient at cutting co2 emissions by producing a table of data the data shows yearly costs to avoid 1000kg of co2 emissions these are divided between energy conservation measures and energy production methods nuclear power is shown to be more efficient than solar power and as efficient as wind power at cutting emissions however the only conclusion the article draws is that nuclear power is inefficient at cutting co2 emissions by your logic i could equally claim in this article using the same source that some environmental groups claim wind and solar power are inefficient at cutting co2 emissions you can see how this would get a little crazy no thirdly there is only one quoted source yet the text reads but environmental organizations indicate the problems with nuclear waste and claim that this energy is neither efficient nor effective in cutting co2 emissions excluding it from clean energy why is it pluralised surely the text should read something along the lines of the wise group a dutch anti nuclear lobby group indicate the problems in conclusion i can see the point you are trying to raise here is based on one guideline as a claim it is not presented as fact that would be fine for articles dealing with philosophical issues or political issues or any other number of normative debates but we are not discussing ethics here we are discussing the efficiency of nuclear power in cutting co2 emissions we have to hold scientific articles to a higher level of proof when it comes to making claims or worse stating beliefs science prima facie is about the pursuit of absolute truth not the espousal of circumscribed belief that way leads to the abuse of science awaiting your reply with interest 86 143 98 152 \n",
      "000  i have no problem with the boeing report but its conclusion is for tether lengths that are much longer than the ones that are being discussed in this article this is where your lack of knowledge about engineering is a problem the mass of a space tether goes up with length assuming it could take the thermal environment you can build a space tether out of kite string but there is a limit on how long this space tether could be made based on the strength to weight ratio of the string this is where designers start making tapered lines that have more cross sectional area in the middle than at the ends even with this there are still limits on the length based on cost and total mass you can make an earth surface to geostationary orbit space elevator using kite string but it will be larger than the earth hence not practical that doesn t mean that you still can t use that kite string to fly a kite obviously you can the difference is in the length the space elevator is 100 000 km long your kite string is only a few hundred feet at most the same applies to skyhooks you could build a 100 000 km long space elevator out of t1000gb carbon fibers but it would have near planetary mass and as a result isn t practical but like the much shorter kite string for flying a kite a skyhook made of carbon fibers in the 200 km to 4 000 km range is possible as to the references not all being open source on the internet there is not much i can do about that you will need to either pay for them or go to a university library that pays for access to them and have them downloaded references 7 18 and 19 are open source reference 19 is only for the part of that paper that covers non rotating skyhooks and does not include the entire paper if you want to see the entire paper do a search using the title on google it is open source quite simply the information is out there but you will have to do a little digging or pay for it you will also need a basic understanding of engineering and orbital mechanics in regards to space tethers for that i recommend the tether in space handbook it is also open source on the internet see reference 7 you could also just read the abstracts for the non open source papers and you will get an idea that this is a workable concept or you could just notice who is writing these reports nasa reference 19 lockheed martin references 5 8 9 and 10 and smithsonian astrophysical observatory reference 7 do you really think these organizations would be wasting their time and money on a lie to conclude with the boeing report the boeing report says 1 his analysis showed that because a hanging tether must be tapered to support its lower end in the gravitational field of the earth achieving a hyperskyhook tether tip rendezvous with a 5 0 km s 16 kft s or mach 16 airplane would require a hyperskyhook tether mass of 25 times the payload mass 5 0 km s is 64 of low earth orbit velocity a tether mass of 25 times payload mass can be built i have no argument with this 2 trying to lower the tether tip speed to 4 0 km s 13 kft s or mach 13 would require a hyperskyhook tether mass greater than 200 times the payload mass 4 0 km s is 51 of low earth orbit velocity a tether mass of 200 times payload mass sounds about right and it is highly unlikely that such a tether length would be economic again no disagreement the tether tip speeds for the non rotating skyhook examples in this article and in all the references i have listed start at 96 of low earth orbit velocity and go to approximately 70 of low earth orbit velocity there is no reason to go any lower as a result the final line of the boeing quote in general the non spinning tether hyperskyhook concept does not look competitive with the spinning tether concepts does not apply for two reasons 1 it doesn t apply to the skyhook lengths in the article and 2 it is an unfounded over generalization that falls under the category of sales bs that is promoting rotating skyhooks do you now understand how the boeing quote that you are so fond of does not apply to the non rotating skyhooks in this article ps the reference numbers are for the article as i have written it since you keep deleting references with your changes the reference numbers keep changing hence you will need to use the article as i have written it if you want the reference numbers quoted here to mean anything so please read this until you understand it and do your research to confirm what i and many others are saying if you run into any problems that you cannot resolve easily write me here and i will do what i can to assist you \n",

      "000 changes to wrong mechanical operations section to the ar 15 article 184 59 118 198 i am sure that you are just doing your job but there need to be some changes made to the ar 15 article page the following is what i suggest and if you have any questions you may want to check the stags arms company website at http info stagarms com blog bid 297530 the difference between gas piston and direct impingement technology for an ar 15 and i do thank you for your consideration merry christmas the difference between gas piston and direct impingement technology for an ar 15 posted by stag arms on fri sep 06 2013 the ar 15 rifle while eminently customizable carries with it a few conundrums one is the choice of operating system do you get a model which uses gas piston technology or the more traditional direct impingement fans of the gas piston will state that impingement models are prone to jamming and often foul easily fans of the impingement model will call gas piston tech mechanically unsound who is correct and what is the real difference between the model types here basic ar functionality what makes an ar 15 an ar 15 to qualify as an ar 15 a rifle must be self loading and be able to perform a specific set of basic functions mechanically without user assistance to be more specific when depressing the trigger the rifle needs to fire a single cartridge and then extract that spent case from the chamber and eject it in some manner next it must then load an unspent cartridge into the chamber the round is plucked from the magazine the breech is then locked and the hammer cocked the rifle will then have a fresh round loaded and again be ready to fire direct impingement how do the original ar 15 models work direct impingement is the original technology devised by eugene stoner propellant gas is bled through a small hole located in the barrel which is then channeled through a very small tube where it can proceed to directly contact or impinge the bolt carrier mechanism at this point the gas is pushed to the rear of the rifle and the spent case is extracted and ejected it is then pushed forward by spring loaded action and strips an unspent round from the cartridge loading it directly into the chamber of the barrel contrary to the statements of gas piston proponents we have put over 2000 rounds through rifles without cleaning and without malfunction gas piston technology how do the new piston technologies work gas piston technology was first used in modern firearms by mikhail kalashnikov on the ak 47 while similar at first blush to direct impingement systems there are a few key differences in operation the firing process again begins with propellant gases being bled into the barrel however instead of being forced into a tube as it is in a direct impingement system it is contained in a separate cylinder this cylinder contains a piston similar in operation to what you may find in an ak 47 the gas moves the piston is in turn pushes the bolt carrier rearward to handle the extraction and ejection process and then is moved pushed forward to the closed position by a spring just as with direct impingement ar 15 which system is better the direct impingement has proven itself through the years on the ar 15 platform and replacement parts are inexpensive easy to obtain and generally made to a set mil spec standard due to the hot gas from the fired cartridge being redirected into the action it will quickly heat up and become dirty requiring a cool down period before the bolt carrier can be removed from the rifle the action of a piston rifle remains cool and clean even after shooting 100 rounds in rapid succession the bolt carrier can be removed immediately and held in your hand without burning yourself the trade off for the action staying cool and clean is that you will experience snappier recoil when shooting which makes the piston rifle a little less accurate especially for follow up shots finally piston system parts are not interchangeable between manufacturers due to there being no set standard and the use of proprietary pistons and bolt carriers 184 59 118 198\n",

      "000  it happened so long ago and the situation was so complex that i think no one really remembers completely correctly what happened as far as i remember it went something like this the owner of chernomorets burgas bought conegliano german a team from a village next to sofia and for various reasons mainly to get the burgas team into a higher division without going through the proper means of actually gaining promotion which is the same as what happened when akademik sofia swapped divisions with vihar gorublyane actually as well as a bunch of other teams such as pirin blagoevgrad merged the two teams which ended up being called chernomorets burgas burgas in group b and chernomorets burgas sofia in group a then a whole bunch of other stuff happened at the same time such as burgas municipality founding their own team which they called chernomorets burgas note the punctuation in all three cases then a bunch of business deals went down whereby neftohimik burgas which had since been renamed naftex got merged with pomorie then that team got merged with one of the chernomorets es then the other chernomorets remained as the official chernomorets but still there was some dispute over players grounds finances then that eventually merged with the first chernomorets then the sofia chernomorets went back to being conegliano german then the neftohimik fans formed a fans club neftohimik which began at the lowest level and in short before 2000 there was a neftohimik and a chernomorets in burgas and after 2010 there is a neftohimik and a chernomorets in burgas and between 2000 2010 a whole bunch of weird random stuff happened that i just don t know how to coherently explain i reckon they can simply be mentioned in the chernomorets burgas and neftochimic burgas 1986 articles as something along the lines of various business dealings led to the formation and dissolution of several clubs including ch b b ch b s and ch b and ultimately led to the current state of the team or something equally inane i dont know basically both the old chernomorets s and naftex are now merged into the current chernomorets while the current neftohimik is a fan s club got it \n",

      "000  dear michael thanks for your reply once you introduce torsion there is this critical uncertainty about what the minimal coupling means the coupling that decouples the torsion altogether always has to be allowed and it s probably the right one there are various other fundamental problems that it s not really clear what the theory should be to describe the real world even if you want to couple einstein cartan theory to ordinary electromagnetism there exists no candidate for a minimal coupling moreover the newer more well defined versions of the einstein cartan theory e g due to stelle and west involving non commutativity as a justification actually predict big enough phenomena and can be falsified for both claims see e g the 2009 paper by gibbons et al the falsification is described in the comment about 1 000 seconds gibbons is a senior guy who wrote important papers with hawking and others i think it s valid to say that any concrete enough version of the theory including couplings to known types of matter can be falsified and has been falsified so the concept is only surviving as a vague one with a wishful thinking that there could still exist a viable version of it but no such version is known at least not a natural one what s really missing is the motivation in string theory one can see that there s no torsion perhaps except for the h field a 3 form but the h field doesn t have the usual normal properties of the einstein cartan torsion field in fact in 4d the h field may be hodge dualized to a scalar the universal axion and such fields are naturally massive otherwise new long range forces would have to exist but they don t if they were not massive you would really modify the gr even at long distances and created new polarizations of gravitational waves altered the prediction for gravitational lensing and other things all these things are absent according to observations as well as string theory moreover the very idea about the minimality of the couplings has been changed in the 1970s by the insights of the renormalization group we no longer prefer simple couplings because they look aesthetically and subjectively simple but because we can technically prove that these couplings and low derivative terms prevail at long distances this modern kind of reasoning leaves no natural room for torsion so all the motivation is just historical in character and can t be reconciled with the modern way of organizing fields and terms in field theory and the people who defend it don t understand the last 60 years in theoretical physics \n",

      "000  may 2009 utc do you mean you can read about those work conditions not see that it s slavery prepare yourself for earthshaking news the wage system is slavery but most people didn t think so slavery means someone who is controlled by someone or something a boss controls a slave but a slave also enslaves a boss being offered a wage you can t live on is slavery all jobs are being eliminated by machine slaves which makes it more obvious than ever before that all people must have a guaranteed minimum income although i prefer the word residual to minimum read child labour try to see it was child slavery into the 20th century it still is today since many children work in their parents business when they ended child labour that didn t set the children free they were free to starve because what they need ed is a gmi having children is a form of slavery too parents become slaves to their children when they need to eat bathe etc but the children are also slaves to their parents so no control also means we ll always be slaves to needing food we can find ways to eliminate all the work with machines which again means all people need a gmi actually all people should own all things because when a few rich people own everything it s obviously slavery how did every person not know that america refused to let any attempts at socialism communism succeed instead they forced it to fail by starting many wars teaching torture you must read wm blum s rogue state fidel castro was right america was wrong and the bls is wrong they always underestimate because most of those people are probably illegal immigrants from many generations back they say every year 50 000 people are smuggled into the us to work as prostitutes that s slavery so can you imagine how many illegals there must be in america hidden behind walls all supporting a few rich slave masters who travel the world raise their families on the backs of slaves in america how can you read about multinational corporations not see they cause poverty in those other countries as well as in america if liberia has a population of 3 million one corporation goes there creates only 2000 jobs then can t anyone see the wage is causing their poverty that s just an example but do you see what i m saying about the wage is the problem worldwide not the solution like america thinks when 3 000 people show up to apply for 20 job openings you know the wage is wrong it s slavery i know i m a slave i know every person is a slave i m right everyone is wrong gerry spence also says we re slaves in give me liberty that s all for now 02 08 31 \n",
      "000  actually to clarify after bret hart was forced to vacate the world title and retire due to a concussion the planned hart vs sid vicious title match was changed less than 48 hours before the match to sid vs benoit since there was no time to build up the match it was decided to do a screwjob finish and then build to the rematch at superbrawl the next month so benoit won the match with sid s leg clearly on the ropes and then the next night on nitro the decision was overturned the official result of the sould out 2000 main event was chris benoit and sid vicious fought to a no contest end of story except not pissed off at the shitty booking benoit confronted booker kevin sullivan who benoit had a personal history with re nancy sullivan then told benoit if he didn t like the booking he could ask for his contract release no questions asked benoit took him up on it and jumped to the wwf the difference between this and the millions of other screwjob dusty finishes was that rather than the belt seemingly moving from one champion to the next then being handed back the bgelt was vacant before benoit won the title thus the overturning of the decision made the belt vacant once more sid also had a seeming title victory only for the result to be overturned due to his pinning the wrong harris officially at the time the belt went from hart to a vacant state to kevin nash awarding the belt to himself okay so vinnie mac has bought at wcw and recognised both benoit s and sid s first wins as world title wins he has also recognised hulk hogan s two awa dusty finishes as official world title wins i don t like it but i guess it s official now the obvious question is since vince owns wwe wcw ecw and awa can he say overturn david arquette s wcw world title win at this point that s just stupid the sandman the sandman won the ecw championship five times not one as the article shows wwa world title where did it go \n",

      "000  stub sorting guidelines i sincerely believe that we really need to lay down the law in stub sorting and really provide a guideline i believe that we should all attempt to reach a general consensus by april 2 2005 in a set of rules that we can follow once we have built a set of guidelines we can formally create a policy out of those guidelines we need to define what a specialized topic stub is how many articles it should cover when is it appropriate to create it what defines its need for its creation what defines its need for deletion what criteria it should follow what are the general steps should one take when sorting a stub whether or not to start using subst for all templates whether or not use subst for all templates created by the meta templates and any other matters that may come up in consideration i thank for initially creating the subpage for the project at wikipedia talk wikiproject stub sorting guidelines even though they have been discussed i feel that we really need to confirm everything for that we should discuss each issue with its own sections and raise a list of issues that we need to nail down before really continuing on the english wikipedia is nearly at 500k articles either the mediawiki software needs to handle stubs such that they can be found with a simple union of categories or the sorting is done manually by wikipedians personally i think the latter is less taxing on the server load especially when we use subst which i think would help the wikipedia out performance wise please make your comments at wikipedia talk wikiproject stub sorting guidelines i apologize for making this somewhat of a spam notice but since the project has more members the project can finally decide on these important issues at hand talk 23 23 15 feb 2005 utc that thing you did hi gadfium a while back i was having trouble with some geography stubs and via the village pump you found out for me that they d been created twice and fixed them what did you do just delete and restore the article which is appearing more than once if that doesn t seem to work try refreshing the category that they re in edit the category page and then change the url to say refresh instead of edit and as a last resort make a trivial change to the duplicated article to force a change to the database 01 47 16 feb 2005 utc changing geo stub this is bordering on the absurd i have ended a number of my articles and stubs with oceania geo stub and someone has changed them to just plain stubs so now i make it just a stub and someone comes in behind me and changes it first to a geo stub and then to an oceania geo stub 07 09 17 feb 2005 utc nuthin to do with me and anyone involved in the stub sorting project should know to leave it as a oceania geo stub which articles do you mean hello i don t even know precisely which articles they are anymore most of my recent edits have had to do with the islands of french polynesia and the cook islands i haven t bothered to look at who s changing the stubs or if perhaps it s a problem with the db i ve had on occasion to submit several times 07 46 17 feb 2005 utc the db may be the culprit these stubs are very heavily used and the system does seem to slow down a bit with them not sure why that would result in the multile template changes though as to an overhaul of the names that would mean changing 50 different regional stubs which between them are used on close to 10 000 articles it s simply not practical hello ah i will look into it tokelau has always been something of a side bar interest for me since they seem to be the left out islands i ll check out what you ve written and add anything that i think i might have to contribute unfortunately for my ability to contribute to these polynesia related articles wikipedia is catching me about 15 years after my interest in the subject reached its zenith i ardently believe in the philosophy that drives wikipedia and so i m doing whatever i can to write edit or create appropriate articles based mostly on memory which is why they seem sometimes perhaps to be a bit light on citation if i had a crappier memory i d be more hesitant about contributing believe me tho when i decided to move to the marquesas specifically to e ao my decision was well researched of course this is the unrealized pipe dream of an adolescent misfit but my extensive research int\n",

      "000  how to insert new data into a sortable table sorting makes the lists more useful but more marginally more difficult to add new data it s not difficult once you understand that sorting numerically isn t possible because of bc in some of the years and commas in the casualty figures all we are doing here is converting those numbers into an alphabetic format that the table can sort sorting for casualties zero padding is necessary if we are going to use comma separators cccc represents the casualty number use formatnum padleft cccc 7 0 example formatnum padleft 300000 7 0 produces 0 300 000 in case of a range like 5 000 10 000 only the first number needs to use the formatnum template to make it sortable the use of the tilde destroys the sort order i don t think it s really necessary since almost all of these numbers are approximate anyway to make years sortable we have to insert invisible characters before the actual values to do this we use anything here is invisible yyyy represents the year for years bc use expr 9999 yyyy yyyy bc example 846 bc becomes expr 9999 846 846 bc note the space just before the it is necessary for years ad we pad left n number of zeros to make the year 4 digits use nyyyy example 3 becomes 0003 example 34 becomes 0034 example 345 becomes 0345 example 1456 becomes 1456 note there is no space before and after the also necessary it looks more complex than it really is trust me ;) \n",

      "000  well dear ahasuerus it is actually difficult to edit any page in wikipedia without muslims jumping at you and trying to censor you with all sorts of excuses you must understand that the freedom of speech for muslims is an alien concept in islamic countries if you say something against islam they kill you where they can t kill you they censor you wikipedia seems to be dominated by muslims this of course is not true in all the pages where muslims have no interest but when the interest of islam comes in they can be quite bullish in making their word prevail but that is another story this article started with some explanation like this in recent years especially after the 9 11 some observers including muslim dissidents have stated that islam presents a threat bigger than nazism not to just the western world but to all non islamic countries they have labeled those who defend islam and try to be politically correct about it the today s useful idiots ali sina states they are idiots because they speak without knowledge of islam and its threat to mankind and they are useful to the islamists with whose help they can penetrate the non muslim countries and destroy them from within the same author writes more abhorrent than war is making peace with evil in the words of the 18th century british parliamentarian edmund burke all that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing those who advocate peace with islam are idiots of this century if we do not stand against islam it will grow and then billions will die trying to appease muslims is foolish it is informed by ignorance of islam most cancers are treatable if detected in time but if ignored they will grow to a stage that will kill you today we have the choice we can either fight islam and extirpate it before it threatens our existence or wait and face the apocalypses muslims obviously don t like ali sina for some reason anything you post here from him they will delete at once so the above passage that explained the concept was deleted the administrator slimvirgin despite claiming impartiality has yet to show that in actions i could be wrong but for reasons that i explained to her i have still to be convinced of that claim i found out that she is iranian like ali sina but of course most iranians are still muslims she even once tried to discredit ali sina saying that he is islamophobic obviously she sees genuine criticism of islam unwarranted and interprets that as islamophobia my judgement about her is just based on my first impression and i could be wrong i have explained to her my concern about her impartiality already and i hope she will eventually show i had misjudged her in wikipedia there is a lot of islamic propaganda which are not true at all but generally critical views about islam do not survive why if wikipedia is impartial shouldn t we give equal space to both sides would we accept if e g scientologist or any other cultists try to take over the wikipedia and disallow any criticism of their cult what is happening is very disturbing there are hundreds of pages in wikipedia that are misleading because they are edited and controlled by muslims and as soon as you try to post anything showing the other side of the coin they revert it and even call your contribution hate speech what about the quran isn t that book a hate speech funny thing is that they throw at you the basic rules of wikipedia when in reality it is they who constanly breach those rules if you try to write anything that muslims don t like they will delete it with invalid justifications this is a very disturbing trend for example the quotes of ali sina were removed because as they said he is not notable there are 200 000 pages talking about faith freedom international there have been death threats in islamic sites against him there are a few islamic sites created just to refute him doesn t all that say that he is notable at least to be quoted finally if he is notable enough to have a page in wikipedia why his quotes should not be published i am not familiar with the structure of wikipedia but i suppose there must be some committee that would check into complaints all i am hoping is that this committee is not already taken over by islamists is there a forum where important questions such as the direction wikipedia is taking is discussed sorry this subject might have not belonged to this page but these are things i would like to discuss is there a place to do that my point is that if wikipedia loses its impartiality and becomes the guardian angel of a certain cult or religion it loses its credibility fast 05 13 2\n",

      "000  i look at a lot of articles such as billcj and many others and it reminds me of books that were published in the 1950 lots and lots of facts boring dull uninteresting pictures picture with no history surrounding what is being published in the 1980 90 s a lot of true aviation historians i e roger freeman jeff ethell warbirds worldwide etc found that aviation historians wanted and needed history recorded the captions of their books detailed who what when where etc as we progressed into the 2000 s i am finding that today s writers unfortunately want to dumb down the article instead of giving all the details to allow the readers to decide how much level of detail he wants again unfortunately billcj as well as others want to take the dick jane approach to aviation history this is suppose to be an online reference encyclopedia often when you google an item the wiki article is the first reference to pop up so this will be unfortunately the first and only reference many will have for a subject a subject has to include everyone that references and item whether it be a 4 year old doing his first model airplane the aviation historian the f 16 buff these articles are also used by serious models who want the details articles only tell part of the story you need the pictures to compliment and point out what the article is discussing in the same vein the pictures need the same level of detailed study if possible and care that is place in creating the entire article having a great and fantastic article such as the f 16 with kindergarten captions makes the entire article pointless it is also unfortunate that other editors like askari mark feels that detailed captions are meaningless to most readers again you can not have an online reference encyclopedia without filling crossing the t and doting the i s without detailed captions it like having no reference section sure you can print captions that state gee an f 16 in flight especially when it is clear that the airplane is sitting on the ground or the case of one article aircraft is on a bomb run when it was clear from the picture that the bomb bay doors were closed no guns in the waist position and the detailed history showed the aircraft actually was a trainer and never left the united state billcj also mentioned are you seriously suggesting that serious historians only read wp articles for the pictures it is a proven fact that 90 of all information processed by humans come from visual data i e pictures etc this is the reason picture books are popular with preschoolers the first thing a majority humans look out when reading any thing is the pictures if the pictures are interesting then many people will stop and read if an aviation historian comes across an article that details the subject matter then he will stop and read the contents it is also been said that this article is not for the f 16 buffs if this is the case then why have technical specifications why have details on each variation why have the nuts and bolts of each individual user etc etc etc why have detailed information regarding anything regarding the aircraft if this subject is not going to reach out to those who can say yes this is true i e the historian buff if you are going to have the nuts and bolts in the article then you have to carry this same thought patterns over to have the nuts and bolts details in the photo captions for example b 52 specifications b 52 costs b 52 variants etc this type of informations is for the aviation historian buff and generally not for the casual reader which is my point in having detailed captions if we dumbdown the photocaptions for the causual reader then this level of details specifications costs variations also needs to be removed as it will only confuse the casual reader and will lead to people calling all such information gobbledy gook if we dumbdown the photocaptions or call detailed information gobbledy gook to most readers then terms such as wing area airfoil zero lift drag coefficient drag area aspect ratio maximum speed combat radius ferry range service ceiling rate of climb wing loading thrust weight lift to drag ratio are gobbledy gook to most non aviation readers billcj has also mentioned that wiki is not the place for f 16 buff s to write article this is complete opposite what the founders of wiki wanted when this project wikipedia as a whole dreamed many many years ago wiki w\n",

      "000  we can have material split across three articles if that is the best way to do it or we can have two articles with a redirect from new antisemtitism to contemporary antisemitism or vice versa the advantage of multiple articles is that it gives a sharper focus on a specific issue the disadvantage is duplication the problem i have with the current article is that it isn t clear to me what the distinction between new antisemitism and old antisemitism is or even if there is one some duplication is ok but when i have no way to decide what should go into new antisemitism and what should go into antisemitism i think there s a problem the advantage of contemporary antisemitism over new antisemitism is that it has quite a clear definition the advantage of new antisemitism over contemporary antisemitism could be that new antisemitism is not just antisemitism in the here and now but somehow something different that we have a history of new antisemitism suggests that a difference exists but i don t see what that difference is the current introduction says that new antisemitism is the wave of antisemitism that escalated particularly in western europe after the second intifada in 2000 the failure of the oslo accords and the september 11 2001 attacks but it then says what is different about new antisemitism is that old antisemitism was largely associated with the political right so i m confused is it the distinguishing factor the timing or is it more to do with the source in which case perhaps we should be talking not about new antisemitism but about new antisemites a new chorus singing an old song in the introduction we mention anti zionism in passing but we don t make clear what the relationship between it and new antisemitism is we just say that there is one the history section talks about a soviet new anti semitism and says this antisemtism was close to its modern form but it doesn t explain what close means presumably there are important ways in which it is similar and ways in which it is different but the article doesn t explain what they are further down we seem to be equating new antisemitism with anti zionism maybe this is the crux of my issues with this article we have anti zionism hatred of opposition to an jewish state we have anti semitism hatred of opposition to the jewish race common usage technically arabs are also semites but lets not go there now we can also identify anti israel sentiment opposition to some or all aspects of israel these things all overlap but it s hard to say that any of them are the same or a subset of each other for example there were jews opposed to the creation of israel because it was man made not created by god and some dislike of israel is anti semitic but not all of it the boundaries are fuzzy but for each of these concepts there is a clear and unmistakable core i can t say that for new antisemtism i can t identify what new antisemitism is that old antisemtism is not to me new antisemitism seems to be a grab bag of an expression that mixes some different issues 1 the apparent resurgence in antisemitism which i suggest properly belongs at contemporary antisemitism 2 the difficulty in distinguishing between legitimate illegitimate criticism of israel which i suggest belongs here or possibly at anti zionism and 3 the changing nature of the anti semite left right arab european russian which i suggest belongs at contemporary antisemitism and or at antisemitism regards ben aveling \n",

      "000  your statements in this section have suggested that an orthodox jew who doesn t strictly follow orthodox halakha is a conservative jew and that a conservative jew who doesn t strictly follow conservative halakha is a reform jew that s simply not the case every religion has a normative set of rules and some people don t follow them conservative judaism isn t a movement for lapsed orthodox jews and reform judaism isn t a movement for lapsed conservative jews these movements are not distinguished by different degrees of observance of orthodox law they each have their own philosophy of judaism and how it should be practiced conservative judaism has a strict halakha that it believes is a continuation of the rabbinic tradition it expects conservative jews to follow that law the fact that many conservative jews don t follow the movement s halakha may be notable but it doesn t mean that conservative judaism has no halakha you ask if all facets of cj today claim to be working in the continuation of rabbinic proccess or not i don t know what you mean by all facets are you referring to members of the rabbinical assembly or individual conservative jews i don t know that every member of the rabbinical assembly is in agreement but the conservative movement s view is that it is continuing the historical process of rabbinic interpretation and halakhic evolution that has been going on for more than 2000 years are there some elements within the conservative rabbinate who don t strictly follow the decisions of the ra absolutely i m sure that there were conservative rabbis who were officiating at civil unions before the movement said it was okay i was too young to know but i imagine that some conservative synagogues may have included women in a minyan before the ra said it was alright and there may be conservative synagogues that won t include women even if the ra says that they must i don t know but i think that they believe that they are acting within the rabbinic tradition i doubt that any of them is saying halakha be damned i m going to do whatever i want yes the conservative movement by its nature expands the boundaries of their interpetation of the law it calls it evolution and it makes no secret of it its viewpoint is that akiva and hillel and rambam and every other rabbi in jewish history has done the same thing until the reactionary orthodox movement slowed the process to a snail s pace anyway i think this discussion is going way off track i m sorry for the tone of my earlier comments but saying that conservative jews are lapsed orthodox is offensive talk contribs ps regarding wolpe and his views of the exodus that s so far afield that i hope you don t mind if i leave my comments on your talk page \n",

      "000  the factor of 10 issue is most propably criminal revisionism like denying holocaust actually happened one thing all the people here and everywhere else fails to take a note when comparing dresden to similar raids with firestorm is the fact that great many of the population failed to take any kind of shelter cause they thought it was just a another false alarm havent practicly ever got a real air raid to the city and what is more the lacking defences there was no or little flak defences and more importantly the city had no dedicated proper air raid shelters what so ever cause resources werent spend on these because city wasnt bombed before so these people claiming 35 000 or less victims dont just have any idea what they are talking about given that the claims for 300 000 victims are propably also false but im pretty sure something like from 100 000 to 200 000 people did actually die just look at tokyo they had a firestorm and people had no shelters and flak and other defenses were ineffective yet it is agreed that there in single night more than 200 000 souls lost their lifes so if you want to compare bombing of dresden the caused loss of life so on to something similar compare it to tokyo firebomb raids cause those are the only similar ones cheers \n",

      "000  south korea started the war the events now taking place in korea broke out on june 25 as the result of a provocative attack by the troops of the south korean authorities on the frontier areas of the korean people s democratic republic this attack was the outcome of a premeditated plan from time to time syngman rhee himself and other representatives of the south korean authorities had blurted out the fact that the south korean syngman rhee clique had such a plan as long ago as october 7 1949 syngman rhee boasting of success in training his army stated outright in an interview given to an american united press correspondent that the south korean army could capture pyongyang in the course of three days on october 31 1949 sin sen mo defence minister of the syngman rhee government also told newspaper correspondents that the south korean troops were strong enough to act and take pyongyang within a few days only one week before the provocative attack of the south korean troops on the frontier areas of the korean people s democratic republic syngman rhee said in a speech on june 19 in the so called national assembly where mr dulles adviser to the u s state department was present if we cannot protect democracy in the cold war we shall win in a hot war it is not difficult to understand that representatives of the south korean authorities could only make such statements because they felt that they bad american support behind them one month before the present developments in korea on may 19 1950 mr johnson chief american administrator of aid to korea told the american congress house of representatives appropriations committee that 100 000 officers and men of the south korean army equipped with american weapons and trained by the american military mission bad completed their preparations and could begin war at any time it is known that only a few days before the korean events the united states defence secretary mr johnson the chief of the general staff of the united states armed forces general bradley and the state department adviser mr dulles arrived in japan and had special conferences with general macarthur and that afterwards mr dulles visited south korea and went to frontier areas on the 38th parallel only one week before the events on june 19 mr dulles adviser to the state department declared in the above mentioned national assembly of south korea that the united states was ready to give all necessary moral and material support to south korea which was fighting against communism these facts speak for themselves and need no comment the united states government tries to justify armed intervention against korea by alleging that it was undertaken on the authorisation of the security council the falsity of such an allegation strikes the eye what really happened it is known that the united states government had started armed intervention in korea before the security council was summoned to meet on june 27 without taking into consideration what decision the security council might take thus the united states government confronted the united nations organisation with a fait accompli with a violation of peace the security council merely rubber stamped and back dated the resolution proposed by the united states government approving the aggressive actions which this government had undertaken the illegal resolution of june 27 adopted by the security council under pressure from the united states government shows that the security council is acting not as a body which is charged with the main responsibility for the maintenance of peace but as a tool utilised by the ruling circles of the united states for unleashing war this resolution of the security council constitutes a hostile act against peace if the security council valued the cause of peace it should have attempted to reconcile the fighting sides in korea before it adopted such a scandalous resolution only the security council and the united nations secretary general could have done this however they did not make such an attempt evidently knowing that such peaceful action contradicts the aggressors plans http www fordham edu halsall mod 1950 gromyko korea html \n",

      "000  with over 100 000 college students studying abroad every year there s bound to be all kinds of tall tales urban legends and misinformation swirling around while there may be grains of truth in some of these stories below are some common misconceptions about study abroad misconception 1 studying abroad is very expensive truth in most cases it is actually cheaper to study abroad let s say the tuition at your school is 5 000 per semester and room and board is another 4 000 now add in the additional fees you have such as health insurance books and laundry you are now well over 10 000 for the semester well all but one of our programs in spain is under 10 000 per semester and that includes everything except your airfare and spending money tab misconception 2 i can t use my financial aid to study abroad truth in almost all cases your federal aid stafford loans pell grants etc can be used to study abroad and in some states you can use your state aid as well it is also not uncommon for your federal aid to increase when you study abroad since some of your school scholarships may not transfer misconception 3 host families are all poor and just do it for the money truth the last thing any study abroad company wants to do is have an unhappy student on their program the goal is for the students to be happy so that they will tell their friends what a great time they had if we were putting students in bad families in dangerous neighborhoods then no one would ever recommend us to their friends since the number of universities that endorse our program doubled over the last year it s a pretty sure bet that students are happy with our choice of families misconception 4 i ll be so busy with schoolwork that i won t get time to see the country i m in truth this one is hysterically funny since your average study abroad student comes home with about 400 photos from a long list of countries students have plenty of opportunities to travel and we even take our students on trips to give them a better feel for the country they are in misconception 5 i might not graduate on time if i go abroad truth if you have already used up all of your elective or general education courses then it s true that you might need to bulk up on courses before or after you go abroad if you plan ahead however and leave some electives open to you then you should be fine the clear majority of students who study abroad still graduate in four years despite being away from their home campus for a semester or two misconception 6 most of the world hates americans so i won t be safe truth there s no doubt that there are a lot of people who don t like the american government but that has nothing to do with the american people if you compare the violent crime rate in the united states to that of european australian or asian countries you will see that the united states is actually far more dangerous there are some areas of south america and africa that are not especially safe but there are also many countries on those continents that are incredibly safe go to the u s state department website and check out the crime statistics on the country you are interested in to see how safe it is studying abroad is a once in a lifetime opportunity that every college student should take advantage of before dismissing it due to the bad experience of one friend or rumors you have had heard speak with your study abroad advisor and get the facts i guarantee that once you look at all that studying abroad can offer you you ll be hopping the first flight abroad one organization that help ensure that you have safest unforgettable yet affordable study abroad experience is academic studies abroad here are some of our very popular study abroad programsin the following countries study abroad spain academic studies offers study abroad programs in barcelona madrid salamanca and sevilla study abroad england academic studies offers study abroad programs in london study abroad italy academic studies offers study abroad programs in florence study abroad france academic studies offer study abroad programs in aix en provence and avignon http www academicstu\n",

      "000  how you would classify any title given by leading newspapers as emotional here are some of the headlines from times of india today future of indian bowling is bleak ranbir kapoor is hard to please why indian men rape that doesn t mean we are going to include things like these in the intros of the articles on indian cricket team ranbir kapoor or indian people facts not opinions should be included in the intros plain and simple delhi tops the list in crimes among all states of india followed by maharashtra you haven t read the article you linked to quote from the article up accounted for the highest 33 9 of the total crime reported in india last year followed by andhra pradesh 13 9 and tn 11 4 it does say that as a city delhi followed by mumbai tops the crime list among the mega cities like i said such a statistic is meaningless unless you consider per capita please read my comment again you cannot say that tamil nadu is more crime oriented than goa because tn is 3 on the list far ahead of goa if the population of goa is 10 times less than that of tn it won t be surprising if 1000 cases were reported in tn as opposed to only 100 in goa delhi and mumbai are the most populous cities in india so it s not surprising that the highest number of crimes are repored in these cities another example india s gdp is higher than that of australia canada singapore and several other countries that doesn t mean that india is the among the richest countries in the world the per capita figures are the true indicator if so then even london is capital of uk does it mean crimes in london could be ignored that s a straw man argument who said anything about crimes being ignored the demographics section of the article on delhi already mentions that delhi accounted for the highest percentage 16 2 of the crimes reported in 35 indian cities with populations of one million or more and delhi accounts for 15 4 of crime against women in indian cities we are talking about inclusion of pov statements like rape and crime capital in the intro of the article if you want to add a section to the article go ahead see new york city crime for an example livemint is also not a valid news paper or recognized source like toi or the hindu mint is published by ht media of hindustan times fame in collaboration with the the wall street journal anyway that s not what we are discussing here toi has given latest stats 2012 hence your info is out dated compared to mine nope like i said you haven t read the article you are referring to it s dated 2011 and i ve already discussed the article contents above new comers should be made aware of these to protect their lives by taking caution or avoiding the city see wp agenda if you want to launch an awareness drive about the crimes in cities like delhi or mumbai or states like up andhra and tamil nadu please start a blog u are worried about all proofs threatening me to stop me interfering in freedom rights to express please stop the wikipedia:Drama i am an indian but i wasn t born in delhi neither have i lived in delhi torreslfchero and anna frodesiak aren t even indians so there is no reason why should we be worried i will bring this to the notice of wiki community soon this should help you wikipedia:Dispute resolution talk \n",

      "000  regarding wars argument thanks i will do that soon here is my thinking krugman s criticism is mentioned 8 times in a article it is intellectual dishonesty and one of character to loudly criticize one school of thought and than refuse to even debate for an hour with an actual austrian economist where he has debated with politicians to boost his book sales in his own words so if his critic is in any way or form relevant why not settle it once for all and end with austrians or if he doesn t want to lose his time on irrelevant things he has humanitarian incentive or why call out austrians in a first place so all in all it comes to this either criticizer and critic is irrelevant and should be deleted or what is in my opinion far better solution this discrepancy should be there for readers to know and decide for themselves this could be done in one or two sentences just a note that he refuses the offer of debate from 2010 although 105 000 fund for food bank new york was established a link to site \n",

      "000  an event in this article is a march 28 selected anniversary may be in html comment from wikipedia village pump how many images are too many i ve only ever seen one image i wanted to add the famous picture of the soldier shot in the head to the spanish civil war page as well as a typical propaganda poster of the times 0000 edt 23 may 2002 imo a couple more legal images would be fine the article only has 1 image after all 04 17 23 may 2003 utc i ve recently brought over a lot of new content from the spanish language wikipedia i ve done my best to integrate it but someone may want to take an editorial pass also it seems to me that we ought to have several sidebar articles dealing with things like the internal situations in madrid and barcelona during the war and there should probably be a lot on spanish anarchism and the various plitical parties of the time that either exists and should be linked to or doesn t and should be written 09 02 8 jan 2004 utc could someone please explain the communism vs civilization comment in the intro thanks 2004 03 14t09 29z an atttribution would certainly be nice and i didn t put it there but it s certainly on the mark as to how some viewed it i ve seen hearst movietone newsreels from the period and that is pretty much the picture they present it s also the rhetoric to be found in franco s speeches during the war it had very little basis in reality in my opinion but leaned heavily on communist atheism and anitclericalism and the destruction of churches and in some cases torture murder etc of clergy and members of monastic orders that occurred in the opening weeks of the war i think the article is accurate in saying that the atrocities in those opening weeks were roughly equal but the fact that many on the republican side targeted the church was endlessly exploited in the nationalists rhetoric and struck a note with conservatives elsewhere who otherwise might have kept more distance from fascism 17 55 14 mar 2004 utc pro nationalist link i for one am inclined to keep for the moment the recently added professor marek jan chodakiewicz on the spanish civil war there ought to be at least one external link to a site more sympathetic to the nationalists than to the republic however i don t think it is a particularly good site there must be a far more comprehensive presentation of this case maybe even with some decent footnotes and or external references itself elsewhere on the web if someone could find a better one and substitute it i think that would be an improvement not neutral i added the note the neutrality of this article is disputed because of the insistence in that general franco or his forces were fascist this is just communist propaganda we know better now communists wanted to overthrow the legal system of liberties in spain to create a system similar to that of the soviet union general franco and his coup prevented that of course the republican legality was not restored but that was because it had not proven safe from revolutionary risks and monarchy was not restored probably because king alfonso xiii fled the country only because his partisans lost a municipal ballot so it appeared to the victors in the war that that king was not reliable to grant individual rights of course franco s dictatorship is more than objectionable but it does not prove that it was a fascist regime this was unsigned but it s user makjavelo frankly i think this one characterization does not make a non neutral article i disagree with much of what makjavelo has just written but i do agree with him that the article or maybe an associated article might gain from a more extensive explanation of the somewhat complicated relationship of franco s politics and falangism in general to fascism as such 17 44 jun 8 2004 utc this seems like petty apology for franco in my opinion not only the communists but the anarchists socialists and most republicans refered to the francoist forces as fascist as well as many historians and authors e g hemingway i forget the exact quote but a christian clergyman who were notoriously right wing at the time in popular belief stated that franco s regime was totalitarian because he controls all aspects of one s life which can be argued because of the high degree\n",
      "000  i am not sure if the word denialist is new which it is you are unlikely to find a source calling an organization 100 or 150 years ago denialist you might find all the characteristics of what denialism is of course it depends on how you define denialism if we define it very narrowly we will only end up with 1 or 2 topics in the category of denialism which clearly is wrong given the similarities of human behavior in those one or two areas with those in other subjects i believe we should do what dictionaries do when they define a word we look at prominent sources like the new york times the new york review of books the london times the economist the wall street journal academic journals scholarly writing popular novels etc to see how the word is used for a new word this determines its meaning until a family of dictionary editors codifies this set of meanings as a family of different definitions that are published in dictionaries since we are not yet at the dictionary publication stage but at the earlier pre dictionary publication stage we have to do more of the hard work ourselves that is all it is clearly a common word in common usage at least in some subject areas one rarely hears the word aids denier although that is essentially what an aids denialist is parenthetically noting that in fact an aids denialist is really an hiv denialist properly speaking and i suspect the phrase holocaust denier will fade from usage now that the new word denialist seems to be gaining popularity if one maintains that there are two separate groups denialists and deniers then why are there no aids deniers why no hiv deniers only denialists seems a bit strange given that human behavior is not much different in all these cases only the topic changes the denying stays the same if putting someone in a denialism category constitutes libel then a very large number of publications worldwide have put themselves in legal jeopardy by publishing articles on aids denialists and other kinds of denialists given that these publications have full time legal staff and large legal budgets and the people making these claims on wikipedia are not lawyers or legal experts this claim seems dubious at best if we accept the gratuitous personal assertions of some that denialism is really a political movement that involves personal gain then creationists creation scientists and intelligent design promoters fall in this category if denialism is more like denial of the evidence then this is less obviously true since there is a dispute about the evidence in these cases if we define denialism as some here claim to only mean those that know they are lying about the truth then where does that leave the most common usage of the word in the phrase aids denialism it obviously cannot mean lying knowingly in this case or probably in all cases i suggest that if one requires a publication to directly make the claim that x is a y to put some article in a category then we would depopulate most of the categories on wikipedia if y has characteristics y1 y2 y3 y4 yn from dictionary definitions or from common usage and this common usage is well understood and evident from publication in wp v and wp rs sources as defined above and if x has most if not all of the characteristics y1 y2 y3 yn then surely x can be put in the category y for example suppose we define a new type of urban area called a townlet being an area with a common administration within a radius of 5 kilometers and a permanent human population of 5000 10000 people then one surely does not need a publication to state that filllsberg is a townlet to put filllsberg meeting all the necessary criteria in the category townlet i also vehemently deny the assertion that denialist is a singularly negative category and so should not be used if so we would get rid of a large number of categories such as pseudoscience also as i have stated repeatedly transhumanists or secular humanists or aetheists might be viewed as denialists by some and might feel perfectly proud to proclaim themselves as denialists of some overwhelming belief or putative evidence for these reasons i think there is nothing wrong with having a category called denialist or denialism the membership of this category might be controversial depending on what we take as the definition of the word any particular subject might or might not be put in that category given community consensus on the word s definition and on the individual case by case analysis of any particular topic subject or article \n",
      "000  i can t offer an offical document either that the classical language category was introduced by a constitutional decree but there are many notifications that are not published on the internet like the official notification that tamil was declared classical language however there are newspaper reports which confirm that the classical language category was introduced by constitutional decree so this is enough to prove it http www deccanherald com content aug142008 editpage2008081384442 asp also i found a conversation of the indian parliament which illustrates the importance of the classical language status for india where mr shivraj v patil compares the status of the scheduled languages to the status of the classical languages shri janardhana poojary sir the demand for declaring kannada as a classical language is pending before the government since 2004 the same answer has been given earlier also my submission before the house is that the kannada text and recorded history belongs to 252 bc the first kannada literary work kavirajamarga was created in 850 ad and it refers to some writings earlier than that the 12th centaury kannada bhakti movement in the form of vachana or oral expression is unparallel in contemporary kirtana which subsequently became karnataka sangeet is an enduring contribution to indian music sir the epigraphical material in kannada numbering over 25 000 inscriptions in stone and copper are rich in style and contents which are not found even in tamil inscription the unesco records kannada amongst the prime scripts of the world sir kannada is among the first living languages of the world in the history of continuous writing system spanning three millennium like hebrew chinese and tamil shri janardhana poojary contd sir the recognition was given to tamil we do not grudge it now sir when the world recognises kannada in india mr chairman please put your question shri janardhana poojary step motherly treatment is being given to karnataka agitations are going on in karnataka about three days back about one lakh people gathered everyday it is going on has the government recognised this is the government going to take any action on this and by what time shri shivraj v patil sir kannada is a very rich language ancient language the matter is before the committee of linguistic experts constituted by the ministry of culture this matter is now with the ministry of culture they are looking into the matter there are demands made by one other section of the society with respect to their language now these demands are being looked into by the expert committee and after the expert committee comes to any conclusion the ministry of culture will take a decision in the matter shri janardhana poojary sir in reply to unstarred question no 1381 it was stated the ministry of culture had received presentation from various quarters for declaring kannada as classical language a committee of linguistic experts has been constituted to examine the claims of any language classical language status this committee will advise the government in the matter this answer was given on 6 3 2006 subsequently to me also the minister of culture has replied saying that it has been referred now the question before the house is as to how long it will go on like this there is a limit to the patience of the people also they are losing their patience you may not believe but they are condemning and criticising the parliamentarians and saying that karnataka m p s are dormant they are inactive mr chairman please ask the question don t make a statement shri janardhana poojary how long will the government take a decision after being referred to the expert committee there has been a lapse of one year what action is going to be taken by the government mr chairman mr poojary this is a supplementary question please ask the question don t make a statement shri shivraj v patil as a matter of fact this question should have been sent to the ministry of culture but because the notice was given to us and the notice was given at the last moment the question was accepted and we are replying to it as a matter of fact it is only the ministry of culture which is in a position to take a decision with respect to this and i would like to say that the language should unit language should not divide many languages in our country are rich languages and they should be a source of our unity rather than division so it would be necessary for all of us to tell our brothers and sisters in the states that on the basis of language division should not be created because the languages are rich because the languages are ancient because interruptions shri janardh\n",
      "000  history vs pre history etc hi as it stands the first paragraph begins with the history of japan probably started around 100 000 bce i d like to point out that perhaps it s not useful or accurate to start a history article with a date 100000 bce like this the reason why in general is that the study of history is typically restricted to the era of written records as the wikipedia article on history will even state there can be probably some fudging because written records can date slightly earlier events or have relation to slightly earlier events in short history and pre history will be divided by written records please take a look at the wikipedia article on history of england in that the upper right table indicates prehistory is before 43 bc and history in the years after this date of 43 bc is generally due to roman era records and again somewhere geographicaly closer to japan in the article history of china the article begins by saying that the history of china is detailed by historical records dating back to 1500 bc i think it s a bit problematic and misleading to state that history began 100 000 years ago because if by history you mean purely archaeological evidence then why stop there history will blend right into pre history and then into archaeology without any meaningful demarcation there is the more casual usage of the word history of course that is history is just the sequence of all events from beginning to end in which case the history of japan goes back to the big bang and all time afterward but as an informative and scholarly wikipedia entry i think this article should be amended with something more accurate more specific referring to what is canonically defined as history i propose something like the earliest records of japan date back to 600 b c e according to the chinese source commonly known as the gishiwajinden or the chronicles of the three kingdoms in the text the country of yamataikoku is mentioned which was said to be ruled by the queen himiko i think this adds to the quality of the article in its specificity and in exposing the reader to the himiko story even here there is lots of controversy as to whether yamataikoku even existed because of lack of archaeological evidence the idea that we have any idea of the specific events of 100 000 bce as the word history demands is somewhat unreasonable any comments \n",

      "000 are you even listening to me in 1838 the armenian oblast armenian province population was numbering of about 165 000 people according to statistics about half were armenian excluding the later 200 000 on its seroundings who later immigrated in 1924 the population of azerbaijan was of 2 million 75 were azeri tartars it compromised of baku province elizavetpol province and the adjoining districts including nagorno karabakh and nakhochevan from 250 300 000 armenians were moved from julfa erivan and nakhichevan in 1604 and following if you claim that there was even as much muslim there you are totally ignoring the history of the period since the partial control by the ottoman nakhichevan and erivan served as depots of goods intermedary from the ouest and east persia even further pushed that but replaced the armenians who would rather trade on the shah s capital you claim having provided data but you have provided absolutly nothing because the only things you have provided even before i covered them and what you present in no way contradict what you claim a projection of that much people 250 300 000 to claim that tartars at least presented that much in the western zone would have been just sensless what i have provided 1 that there were reasons specifically targetting armenians which do not apply and were not applied to muslims 2 i have provided materials excluding the muslims in reference to the depopulation 3 i have provided materials equating the population with the word armenian 4 i have provided a reference prior to gultestan treaty and you dismissed the author while in wikipedia we only present sources and if there exist critics from notable published materials of those sources what you think of the author is original research you answered by presenting 13 14th century and post gulestan materials which in no way have i contested nor do they contradict what i have been saying i have provided figures of armenian moved which by projection represent 2 million or more armenians if projected for 1918 and those excludes the recorded numbers of armenians who escaped depopulation and inspite of it there still remained a considerable number of armenians pre gulestan which i also documented i have documented everything i have been claiming you request things that do not exist because there was no nakhochevan delimitation in that period nor statistics for a bordering which is quite modern in comparaison to abbas period in short what you have highlighted is that the word armenian has no place in this article and that you have no intention to improve it you know that what you propose is misleading but you still claim it is neutral as we speak 98 of nakhichevan population is azeri so claiming depopulation could only be misleading in that it suggest that azeris were those moved when the armenians were those mostly affected obviously here we do have a problem and as it appears you in no way want to correct it ix \n",

      "000 wellington metropolitan vs wellington urban as someone who has lived in wellington off and on for 20 years i now regard it as my home town in all of this one crucial fact is overlooked the wellington metropolitan area includes the kapiti coast as far as waikanae there are several thousand people who commute to other parts of the urban area everyday and the suburban rail network goes to paraparaumu with a planned extension to waikanae almost everyone i know thinks of the kapiti area as part of greater wellington so i am left wondering why the boffins in wellington refuse to include this area in the urban data yes i know there is the stretch of road past paekakariki but that s no different from the haywards road or the hutt road in reality in spite of the classifications wellington remains the second largest metropolitan area in new zealand by my calculation the population including the kapiti suburbs is around 415 000 still around 30 000 more than christchurch if christchurch gets to include non contiguous suburbs eg halswell lyttelton then so should wellington not only that banks peninsula was included in christchurch in 2006 so that bob parker could become mayor of christchurch and promote christchurch as the second largest city in nz the reality is christchurch has an inferiority complex and i can say that because i m from there it doesn t change the fact that wellington has more people and is more important than christchurch no matter which way the geographers and politicians want to spin it instead of merging the pages how about creating a new one for greater wellington which could include kapiti \n",

      "000  operation northwords listing operation northwoods as a conspiracy theory is bias and unfounded by the very definition of conspiracy theory that this article gives if a conspiracy theory is a theory involving a coordinated group which is or was secretly working to commit illegal or wrongful actions including attempting to hide the existence of the group and its activities then operation northwoods does not fit the criteria first of all the cia does not try to keep its self hidden or secret it is a known agency and the plans of operation northwoods are no more a conspiracy theory just because they where kept secret then any of its other actions that the cia plans or performs on a daily basses that are all kept secret from the general public secondly operation northwoods was not a conspiracy within the cia either not one cia member kept it a secret from anyone who should have known about it it other words the protocols and the chain of command for this plan was followed precisely as they should have been and because of that fact it was shot down the architect of the plan was fired the plan never took action and it was well documented which is why we know of the plan under the freedom of information act this is the exact opposite of a conspiracy theory conspiracism the section conspiracism says conspiracy theories are often not taken seriously because so many conspiracy theories almost by definition lack readily verifiable evidence this phrase is unnecessary to introduce conspiracism and is full of weasel words often taken not seriously has anybody made a statistic many conspiracy theories lack verifiable evidence how many and it happens almost by definition what in the definition states tht the theory has to lack evidence if nobody has nothing to comment about that i will delete the sentence above i disagree with the above sentence and for sure it is not neutral but guess that it meant that the conspiracy groups hides the evidents and or create them vide the 9 11 passport i don t want to argue was it fabricated i mentioning that accorsing to some people it was fabricated sequence of sections and bias the way this article is set up suggests a very very strong pov and it is not even really attempting to be neutral first problem is the examples for one they shouldn t be the second thing since it s mainly a partial list this should be towards the end of the article also there is the descriptions the john f kennedy assassination was a plot by people in high places and not the work of lone gunman lee harvey oswald oliver stone s film jfk is based on this premise while this is a conspiracy theory one i think is somewhat likely it is actually the most extreme of conspiracy theories in this regard other theories were that this was a mob hit or carried out by cuba or the soviets the ufo conspiracy theory is also stated in the more extreme manner some theories are that the u s government conceals an alien presence because they re afraid of it causing a scare which sounds more reasonable than to be used for war and other ideas mainly towards the new world order also the fourth section is almost completely dedicated to explaining conspiracy theories in a discrediting manner treating them like psychological abnormalities or attempts by confused individuals to make sense of a nonsensical world it seems to be the most common and most annoying criticism of conspiracy theories this section also is half of the actual article with the rest mainly being an explanation of the terminology and even mentions of fictional conspiracies very little of this article goes to treating conspiracy theories as a justifiable practice in critical thinking that like all legitimate studies can lead to rather ridiculous theories for instance there are legitimate questions about 9 11 such as the 100 000 given to atta by a head of the isi there are also allegations that the 9 11 commission due to its structure and the associations of its head with the administration was unable to do a thorough and independent investigation with it ultimately being little more than a coverup in every case critical thinking demands some form of explanation or theory for such facts for instance one is that the administration is trying to cover up connections between pakistan and or saudi arabia and 9 11 this w\n",

      "000  enough with the ad hominems please address the points made which are relevant to the article don t distract yourself from the collective efforts to bring this discussion back on track restoring wp npov to the paris article i invite everyone to read again the wp npov policy of wikipedia editing from a neutral point of view npov means representing fairly proportionately and as far as possible without bias all of the significant views that have been published by reliable sources on a topic all wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of view npov is a fundamental principle of wikipedia and of other wikimedia projects this policy is nonnegotiable and all editors and articles must follow it currently the article is heavily biased towards a historical heritage representation of paris the article is structured the same way as the article of pompeii with most of its contents dedicated to describe past history heritage sites tourism and past culture the difference with pompeii though is paris hasn t been destroyed by a volcano 2 000 years ago and here goes the wp:Pov facts about what is paris today are marginalized in shrinked sections burried at the bottom for the good of the debate here are some facts about today s paris we should all remember economically speaking paris is among the top 5 cities generating the most wealth in the world it hosts more headquarters of fortune global 500 firms than london or new york demographically speaking it is a megapolis of 12 million people inhabitated by large communities coming from all countries in the world regarding infrastructures it is one of the most important transport node in europe with 4 airports 6 major railway stations linked to 4 different high speed rail lines and hosts the second largest river port in europe to know whether or not the economics demographics and infrastructures aspects of paris are represented fairly proportionately in the current article i invite everyone to compare the size of the said sections with the one of those dedicated to history heritage and culture which in the case of paris ignores its modern aspects as everyone obviously agreed here i ve counted words of each section including their paragraphs in introduction and in order to give a point of comparison i ve done the same about london which is a similar size capital city of a similar country field of interestparislondonnumber of words of totalnumber of words of totalhistory3 573 words22 2 048 words17 heritage4 277 words26 204 words2 culture2 545 words15 1 661 words14 subtotal10 395 words63 3 913 words32 economy673 words4 727 words6 demographics852 words5 1 605 words13 transport819 words5 1 693 words14 subtotal2 344 words13 4 025 words33 overall total16 388 words100 12 131 words100 it s worth being mentionned though that london s culture section is entirely dedicated to today s culture but even putting that aspect aside the london article which seems well balanced talk about as much of history heritage and culture than it does of economy demographics and transports in the case of paris sections about the past aspects are 4 5 times bigger than those about today s aspect in reading this article we can decently believe that today s paris is judged not relevant any\n",

      "000  male graduates before 1969 i ve added mention to the trivia section regarding men who matriculated at vassar immediately after world war ii on the gi bill i suppose this could be classified as original research not sure my father was in that first graduating class that included men eleven of them a scan of the relevant portion of the program from the graduation ceremonies can be found here again if this constitutes original research i guess it can be pulled though it is a rather fascinating bit of history bias there are many abundantly clear examples of bias in this article vassar is often praised for its beautiful campus a 1000 acre 4 km lot of land marked by period and modern buildings that is also an arboretum since that time it has maintained its reputation as one of america s outstanding liberal arts colleges and is especially noted for its tolerant social atmosphere the college is a member of the little ivies an unaffiliated group of elite northeastern liberal arts colleges vassar is a leader in producing doctoral candidates vassar students are well known for their individuality creativity and open mindedness many beautiful old brick buildings are scattered throughout the bucolic campus but there are also several modern and contemporary structures worth noting did this come straight from the college s website bias i disagree with the above allegation of bias in the article i found no similarity between the vassar web site and the article the information in question the attractiveness of the campus seems fairly innocuous and is fairly similar to the type of information in wikipedia articles about other liberal arts colleges and several universities the article reads like synopsis of commercially available background information in colleges guide books while i would have written the main paragraph differently i hardly think this qualifies as biased and without some criteria to differentiate this page from other pages on other schools i believe the objection should be removed from this page the article violates wikipedia s npov policy clearly wikipedia is an encyclopedia a place to find innformation not a forum for opinions if you are unwilling to make changes then i will go ahead and make them myself also you should leave you name when commenting also i realize that the article is not up to date and violates wikipedia s policy against personal research ie students spend time doing ceratin activities on a certain lawn i do agree that much of the information on this page is somewhat biased and the architectural info came from me not the college s website so my apologies for lack of neutrality there however if you edit the page to remove said bias please re read your edits before saving the page simply removing phrases and not doing a little copyedit makes the page read poorly i have made some minor edits just so that it reads a little cleaner hopefully not restoring anything that you feel is biased i think the bigger issue is that this page has become a series of lists academic majors famous alums residence halls with little encyclopedic content and is an embarrasment compared to other articles about comparable schools someone please help to fix this article \n",

      "000  great but what i meant about weakest link is that i don t see an explicit connection to developments in noise music in the sources i ve seen have you got a source that place s something called post industrial in the context of the history of noise music i m presuming this is the umbrella term invented by music journalists to cover any music that is stylistically informed by industrial music yet is at the same time far enough removed to warrant the post tag unless the sources are good on this it s too divergent in my opinion to include right now some of what might be called post industrial is not that far removed from pop music so it simply doesn t warrant inclusion you might as well do a section on death metal and its precursors but this kind of bifurcatory dot connecting is hardly the best way forward especially as the title of this article arose as a result of someone trying to define a single genre known as noise music personally i think it is perhaps a stretch too far to start covering any kind of music or any composer artist that might have dabbled in a bit of noise making and i don t think that is what should happen with this article unless the claims are sourced and that s why i mentioned already that we should try and stick as closely as possible to what the main sources dealing with the historical use of sound noise in music have to offer we now see a number of artists for example jeff mills being redefined as a post industrial musicians and the sentence throws in the year 2000 despite the fact that mills has been associated with techno for 20 years now i find this kind of redefinition without strong sources problematic \n",

      "000  items not yet ready for prime time scholarly review on wikiversity as you may know killerchihuahau summarily baleeted these essays from the pages of wikiversity presumably because she disagrees with the notion of using the donor funded site to educate 21st century youth in modern concepts of ethical organizational management moulton abolishing the wikipedia bans as a governance tool the following article originally appeared as an add on comment in the p2p foundation s blog michael bauwens the editor of the site elevated the comment to a main article in its own right the governance model of wikipedia was so anachronistic that it took me over a year to place it in the timeline of historic governance models adopted at various times in the annals of human history the thing that stymied me was the prominence of blocking and banning as the primary tool of governance i simply couldn t place that among the recognized tools of governance in any historic context and then i happened to take a look at the oldest surviving account of secular law the code of hammurabi of 1760 bc of the 282 laws that hammurabi of mesopotamia carved into the stone tablets take note of the very first one 1 if any one ensnare another putting a ban upon him but he can not prove it then he that ensnared him shall be put to death evidently banning ostracism was a common practice in the tribal cultures in the middle east some 4000 years ago at the dawn of civilization capricious and spurious banning was evidently such a common and egregious abuse of tribal overlords that hammurabi made it a capital offense to ban someone without proving just cause and yet on wikipedia indefinite blocks and bans without due process are a common occurrence that is to say the prevailing governance model of wikipedia corresponds to a pre hammurabic tribal ochlocracy that is so anachronistic it predates the advent of the rule of law when thomas jefferson and the other founders drafted the us constitution one of the provisions they put in article one was a prohibition against bills of attainder a bill of attainder is the technical term in the law for declaring a person to be an outlaw without respect to having violated any specific law that applies equally to everyone the founders excluded bills of attainder from the tools of governance because 4000 years of political history had demonstrated that such a toxic practice is corrosive and ridden with corruption and invariably sinks any government that comes to rely on it the irony here is that wikipedia purports to be the sum of all knowledge with an educational mission that reaches out to students teachers and scholars around the world and yet those exercising power in wikipedia have not yet learned the oldest and most profound lessons in the annals of human history lessons enshrined in the first written law and in the first article of the us constitution the consequence of adopting such an anachronistic governance model is that wikipedians are fated to relive and reify the long forgotten lessons of history they relive those lessons by reprising the same kind of political dramas that fill the history books since the dawn of civilization the anachronistic governance model which jimbo wales foolishly and mindlessly introjected into wikipedia is simply not a sustainable model in this day and age summary and capricious banning wasn t even a sustainable model some 3768 years ago when hammurabi first singled it out as an unacceptable practice in a civilized culture so what to do about it the answer can be found in the second law of hammurabi s code as hammurabi advises the solution is to tell them to go jump in the lake or as they say in yiddish nem zich a vaneh further comments by readers of the p2p foundation may be found http blog p2pfoundation net\n",

      "000  what i appreciate about this discussion is that it is being conducted by people who demonstrate a great deal of concern for the issues involved both the subtleties and the sweep of the issue i believe this is appropriate though admittedly tiring because in legal matters a great deal often hinges on a comma or the inclusion exclusion of the word not or other such maddening technicalities ergo shakespeare s famous dictum about lawyers consejo de salud playa de ponce v rullan does provide federal precedent and a framework for discussion and debate however the rullan ruling is not ultimately dispositive of a u s constitutional question or territorial status issue since the u s supreme court is the court of ultimate and binding jurisdiction in both of these areas the language of the rullan ruling did not grant full constitutional privileges to puerto ricans living on the island itself as opposed to those living on the mainland the rullan court stated that congress today thus must afford puerto rico and the 4 000 000 united states citizens residing therein all constitutional guarantees however as stated earlier puerto rico is subject to the u s congress plenary powers under the territorial clause of article iv sec 3 of the u s constitution u s const art iv 3 cl 2 the congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the united states the rullan ruling occurred in 2008 three years later in 2011 insular puerto ricans have neither u s congresspersons nor u s senators and they cannot vote for a u s president therefore insular puerto ricans are not fully enfranchised u s citizens and they have not been extended enjoyment of all rights and obligations under the u s constitution it is thus clear that in the exercise of its plenary powers the u s congress has chosen to ignore the rullan ruling the operative word in this discussion and i understand the frustration on both sides is the usage of the word must in the rullan ruling as forceful as that word sounds it was mis used by the rullan court because the u s congress clearly ignored it again a lower federal court is not the court of ultimate jurisdiction for the issues addressed by rullan the u s congress ignored it puerto ricans on the island are not fully enfranchised and therefore do not have enjoyment of all rights and obligations under the u s constitution i hope this helps your process of consensus i provided it in that spirit \n",

      "000  oddly enough i am truly agnostic on this particular bit of software it s always been my position that it should have a fair trial but it seems that at every step things have been problematic first off there was the fact it was introduced immediately on the heels of two other major ui changes the addition of revision deletion to the admin toolkit and the switchover to vector then there was the fact that the version on the test wiki was not the version to be introduced here so nobody could even test it properly on the testwiki the trial criteria were not developed until just days before the trial itself and there were no benchmarks set to determine whether or not there was any change over time or whether that change was positive or negative the majority of early supporters in the original pc poll wanted it to be focused on blps but for some reason at the end of the poll it was decided that pc should be applied to currently protected or semi protected articles instead and those were the articles targeted in the trial the wmf press on the subject specifically referred to the ability for anonymous and newly registered users to edit long time semi protected articles of high profile topics the george w bush article was specifically mentioned without discussing this in advance with the community it lasted less than 2 days on pending changes with mountains of vandalism during that period then there was the promise by the lead developer that pc would be shut off at the end of 60 days unless the community clearly requested otherwise four days later when lead developer responsibility changed hands the new lead developer announced that he would rather keep things running during any review on a quiet page with only the most interested editors watching even with all of this disarray i still hoped that we could get a reasonable trial of the tool it was agreed that we d start off with 2000 articles in the trial starting with just a few and ramping up so that we d hit the 2k articles around 2 weeks into the trial with the expectation that if things went well we d add more incrementally perhaps up to 10k however only a handful of administrators participated in adding articles to the trial and i don t think we ever got above 1500 further at that point we d pretty well added all of the articles that were eligible under the criteria for the trial except for ones in categories where one or more administrator had objected to inclusion as best i can tell their objections were based on the articles being honey pots for socks i was one of the most active admins in adding articles to the trial and i confess i sneaked in a pile of blps that technically didn t meet the criteria they had been semi protected in the previous 6 months and had fewer than 10 watchers indeed one of the most telling factors on this trial was the fact that very very few administrators appeared to be interested in using the tool as currently configured i also note that the time that it has taken edits to be reviewed has continued to lengthen as time has gone on a few weeks ago i led a panel on the topic of pending changes at the new york city wiki conference thanks to dgg becksguy and jamesofur who were also on the panel that same day keynote speaker clay shirky talked about the fact that once a culture is broken it is not able to rebound back to its prior state in my own closing statement i reflected on that comment and wondered if pending changes might be the culture breaker for wikipedia and if it was whether or not that would be a good or bad thing certainly the manner in which this entire trial has proceeded has shown that there are some pretty huge differences in what people perceive as the way we do things around here i don t think the pending changes software or its use will be the culture breaker but the manner in which it is being integrated and promoted into the project might very well be i am very considerably concerned that this pressure to keep a bit of trial software running has resulted in a level of divisiveness between good faith wikipedians from which the community may not recover \n",

      "000  lets do some pov analyse the text now says however on 6 june the effective strength of the 12th ss panzer division was 20 540 men and 150 tanks 42 by 23 august it was reduced to weak infantry elements no tanks no artillery the editor claims the statement come from stacey colonel charles perry bond major c c j official history of the canadian army in the second world war volume iii the victory campaign the operations in north west europe 1944 1945 what says the article of colonel stacey on 22 and 23 august army group b reported3 the state of its eight armoured divisions as follows 12th s s panzer division 300 men 10 tanks no artillery stacey says that the rest of the divisions were casualties no the 12 ss suffered 8 000 casualties and the rest was pulled out of the line the remaining 300 men are a battle group lend to another division from the 12 ss article the units in the division that were not fit for combat were ordered to pull back to germany on 8 september leaving behind a small kampfgruppe attached to the 2nd ss panzer division das reich with citiation so what makes the editor here he takes a statement then he poved it a bit with the word reduced than he claims no tanks knowing it is wrong by the way the reported strenghts were grabenst rke the sense of this statement was to bring the reader some idea about german casualties on this battle by the way the 12 ss not even participated the full battle eye thats what u call reliably sourced material maybe the editor should be banned for a short while he faked a quote to support his pov please tll me eye is this pov which encyclopedia would come to the moronic idea of using this statement when it his has no overall figures \n",
      "000  dear alexikoua i am wondering whether there is any informative value in citing the so called 1910 census this is not an official census it belongs to a series of documents that had propaganda value in the sense that it was createed in 1919 to help the greek delegation persuade other participants in the peace conference to yield to its demands and maximize greek territorial gains in asia minor i would also be thankful if you could please provide your source for the numbers you cite in the 1914 ottoman census table the reason i am asking is that i have karpat s book right in front of me and some of the numbers differ somewhat for example greeks of adana vilayet amount to 8 537 in karpat 1985 pp 172 188 not 12 000 finally i would like to add a word of caution if i may as i found out reading a note in kostopoulos tasos 2007 polemos kai ethnokatharse p 171 i can confirm this in a couple of days by comparing karpat s book pp 170 189 and alexandris alexis 1999 the greek census of anatolia and thrace 1910 1912 a contribution to ottoman historical demography in d gondicas ch issawi eds ottoman greeks in the age of nationalism princeton pp 58 65 despite having the same name the boundaries of vilayets vary between ottoman censuses and that of the ecumenical patriarchate the 1914 census not including certain sanjaks like kutahya afion karahisan canik samsun eskisehir etc in vilayets for these minor but existing nonetheless discrepancies between the two to be eradicated it is advisable to adjust one of the two administrative divisions to the other s a model being provided by kostopoulos 2009 pp 170 1 \n",

      "000  no point in concealing the fact that oil and gas exports and petroleum price play important role in the russian economy however there is no point in highlighting this fact too much since it borders with spreading the myth that russian economy is only oil and gas and nothing or almost nothing else few facts significant growth of oil prices started only in 2004 2005 but the russian economy started growth and rather large growth well in 1999 2000 russian economy is not only export the recovery of oil and gas and other minerals was only 9 of gdp in 2011 and only 6 8 was oil and gas with figures not much larger in the previous years the share of oil and gas in gdp gradually falls unprocessed oil and gas takes only 45 of russian exports more of the rest are oil based products and fuels but this is considered manufacturing so the phrase in one of the last edits about the oil and gas which is the majority of russian exports is oversimplified and certainly not correct if we speak about raw materials vs manufacturing federal budget grew much faster in the last decade than oil prices and it is not clear whether a five fold increase in price of oil and gas is correct description it was four fold increase in 2000 2011 but seven times increase in 1999 2011 in 2008 only 23 of federal budget revenues came from exports oil and gas customs tariffs and 18 from taxes on petroleum and mining companies however when we speak about the consolidated budget federal budget regional budgets the similar figures for oil and gas would be just 14 and 10 all this means the following the economic growth in the early 2000s was not very much dependent on oil and gas prices so it is incorrect to ascribe early economic growth under putin to petroleum prices overall the dependence whatever its scale of the russian economy on oil and gas is not putin s invention and the share of this sector in the russian gdp actually is falling however oil and gas money constituted a very large share of the federal but not so consolidated budget in the putin era this means that it is more correct to speak that it is not the russian economy on the whole but the federal budget which is dependent on oil and gas and a qualitative addition to the figures russia is a northern cold country and russia is industrial country which means that it needs lots of fuel for itself but it is also a very resource rich country so no wonder that it produces much energy have lots of facilities for that and takes the opportunity to export abroad a lot every country in similar conditions does that the u s canada norway this is not good or bad feature of the economy just the fact talk we need to revert your additions on oil and gas simply because they are not entirely correct factually and because all the key information in more generalized and accurate form is already in the lead but if you have proposals to make some important additions in accurate wording let s discuss them talk \n",

      "000 long wave because of the long wavelength needs impractically large antennas to broadcast with any reasonable efficiency the tallest ever man made structure before the burj khalifa was a longwave transmitter warsaw radio mast its ground wave range is also relatively long compared to medium wave which means that the transmissions will reach out over a much wider area 1000 km is not unusual that may sound like an advantage but at such low frequencies bandwidth is at a premium so the longwave band has to be rather small it s just over 100 khz wide in europe combine those two effects and and what happens is that a single medium powered transmitter will swamp a very large area making that frequency unusable to anyone else and taking away almost 10 of the available frequency space within that wide area so the longwave band is good purely from a transmission effectiveness point of view if you ignore lightning interference but it doesn t work too well on a economical commercial level this is one of the reasons the fm band was moved from 50 mhz to its modern place after ww2 the higher frequencies are much more strongly localised to one area so there is room for a lot more stations in a given space and stations can cater more easily to smaller local audiences which keeps costs down and attracts more people a longwave transmitter for a single large city is silly but for vhf it works \n",
      "000 now even the discussion attempts to further contextualize and diminish the red army s crimes the red army s crimes remain crimes there is always a context and a reason for any crime committed by anyone what wehrmacht or ss soldiers did or did not do in no way justifies or sufficiently contextualizes away rapes committed against women aged 8 and lower to 80 unfortunately that is what this article in its present form attempts to do on top of that this article about rape gives no voice to the raped and only offers voices of the perpetrators that dismiss the accusations it s rather perverse misogynistic and revisionist a more appropriate balanced and meaningful way to tackle this topic would be to give a straight forward account of the wide spread rapes violence by the red army including accounts from various nazi women victims after that background context should be given to help understand why this happened but never in a way that implies that crimes do not remain crimes in addition a section on soviet russian ways of interpreting handling on the violence rapes would be informative as well in its current form this article does wikipedia a disservice and is yet another example of a biased and amateurish account of history that cements wikipedia s reputation as an unreliable source of information it is only by tackling these types of issues effectively that the wikipedia community can prove it can be a viable source of information re profoundly a historical suggestion contextualizing the supposed crimes as claimed by udibi is not the same thing as diminishing those acts of punishment inflicted on the nazis for murdering 20 000 000 people i find his reference to ss paramilitary as soldiers to be deeply disturbing a historical ill informed and suspicious as ss paramilitaries were not soldiers and were not even part of the military while nazi acts of genocide do not in themselves justify rape they make it very understandable why people who assisted in the worst mass murder in history were punished by the surviving victims related the nazis were very popular and had massive support from the population who in turn offered no resistance to the nazi regime he who keeps silent consents these women were therefore active supporters of the holocaust it would not have been difficult for them to fight against the nazis in some way and they should not receive sympathy for not doing so and allowing 20 000 000 people to be murdered i really see no problem of revisionism here i recommend that other editors be very wary of this proposal to create a self proclaimed more appropriate balanced and meaningful way to tackle this topic as it may lead us to perpetuating the moral equivalency arguments of covert holocaust deniers i think we also need to consider whether this is not just a case of hundreds of thousands of german women getting lucky with their liberators a view shared by many germans described in the fall of berlin 1945 and then telling local nazi leaders or werewolf members that they were raped in a regime where they could not openly have any sort of relationship with russians anonymiss madchen\n",

      "000 honestly the way wiki is treating this is a joke a i could have cited news sites but since when is a news site worthy of an academic cite b if the person that wanted peer review felt like it he would have sought it 20 years ago he chose not to do it but none the less his work is known and was mentioned in many math related forums and most ignored it c only the recent 2012 open source test of the work proved the 30mod algorithm is a major thing in math again github is a programmers resource and it was not until a computer used the actual 30mod algorithm that it was shown to be a big thing and since then some news sites have covered it but i chose not to cite them due to imo they are not npov but none the less they covered the story d the fact is a major computer site where programmers have free reign to challenge any claims exists and for over two years not one programmer challenged the findings e so what if the person that discovered it works outside of academia and has no regard for normal peer review the fact is he has no peers if you ask some in academia that know of his work and i am one of those people that know of the work and how brilliant the work is now to summarize we have a bunch of pags about primes on wiki and even pages created after his discovery that use his discovery ie the sieve of atkin 60mod work is his work discussed in the public forum and usenet math and physics forums is where he chose to discuss his amazing work so now you have 2004 sieve of atkin using a 60mod algorithm guess what that was in his 1995 paper so does wiki acknowledge that no and i didn t even bother to waste my time of the 60 mod algorithm since the big deal as you are saying is the pyprimes test and i cited that very well it s a program created in python i cited the wiki python page then i cited github for both pyprimes and the pyprimes testing now while math is m forte i am sufficient enough in computer skills to understand what github is and to understand how to read the speed tests and the prime spirals smoked every algorithm there is now anyone can download python which i have done and download pyprimes which i have done and run the tests guess what just like a math experiment it is duplicated so github and the tests which are not new should be enough to begin a wiki page on this truly amazing discovery in math i myself became aware of the first paper in 1995 as did others in aademia recently i became aware of news sites running stories citing what i copied the links to the github tests while some here can say well it s not ama so what in the world of primality testing primes spirals as per the pyprimes results shows prime spirals are a big deal now i tried to be npov in giving all sides of the story adoni has a valid 1995 claim i can verify it and i chose not to but i cited a drexel math forum and i could have cited many other math sites discussing his 30mod 60mod and 90mod prime work in the 1990 s is this signficant you bet it is since 60mod prime sieve aka atkin sieve is 20004 so his 60mod prime work is well before it now the github tests mentions croft spirals that s due to in 2010 a person named croft registering a web site and ripping off the 1995 work my opinion now croft can say all he wants that he found it playng his guitar or whatever he is claiming the fact is anyone can document adoni with prime theory from the 1990 s saying 30mod 60mod and 90mod is the key 9 years later sieve of atkin appears well that s only a rehash of the adoni 60mod work from the 1990 s yet no one is giving him credit 2010 croft puts out his 30mod work and its inserted into pyprimes on github and it smokes every major prime algorithm there is and all of them have pages on wiki as i cited so 2012 a work on github verifies how important to primality the 30mod spirals are but he says croft spirals well guess what helixq is now out there and taking 100 credit for the 1995 work of dr adoni my site to a drexel math site from the 1990 s mentioning 30mod prime work prime spirals is a major cite since adoni could care less about the ama or whatever in all probability he will soon be nominated for a nobel on his work that is how important it is think about it not one prime algorithm could beat the ancient sieve of eratosthenes none of them on a computer creating primes all other algorithms are terribly slow the only two fast generators from scratch are the ancient sieve of eratosthenes and the prime spirals and the winner was prime spirals now i can cite recent news articles about it laughing at academics it links to that said it was no big deal in the 1990 s who now all look foolish due\n",

      "000  why i don t edit often anymore back in the day i used to edit wikipedia on a fairly regular basis one of the pages i edited was the exile one detractor of the exile peter ekman was so pathologically obsessed with discrediting the periodical that he would devote weeks at a time to blanking and otherwise vandalizing the exile article while launching reckless accusations at everyone who defended the exile although many editors did our best to contain mr ekman eventually he wore me down it just wasn t worth it spending my free time containing the vendetta of some aggrieved middle aged jerk as a parting bow in my too long ekman drama i wanted to post here a summary about mr ekman s character and the original wiki text that prompted mr ekman s crusade about peter ekman peter ekman is the aforementioned hack journalist who crusaded against the exile but once upon a time ekman actually had an impressive sounding job working as an editor for the moscow times and dispensing right wing platitudes in the heart of the former communist empire moscow in the 90s was a place where failures didn t fail and for a long time ekman didn t fail despite his total lack of social graces and limited intelligence eventually his columns attracted the ire of the fellow moscow publication the exile originally the exile was planning only on criticizing ekman s written work but ekman s response was righteous menacing and hinted at violence so the exile s added a personal detail they included the account of a female employee who had been subjected to unwelcome sexual advances by mr ekman mr ekman had groped the employee while inviting her to a weekend get away while his russian bride was out of town ekman responded with the same witless ape shit animosity that i have since personally witnessed many times on wikipedia ekman attempted to get the exile banned from johnson s reading list by declaring the exile was a fascist neo nazi periodical ekman s evidence for such nazi sympathies was a spoof fashion piece entitled the exile s third reich uniform of the week in which a fictional gay fashion designer breathlessly reviewed the 1938 version of the nazi field bishop uniform eventually ekman lost his position at the moscow times since then he s occasionally surfaced as a professor of finance at various 3rd rate universities and of course here on wikipedia the following is an excerpt from the wikipedia article on the exile that prompted mr ekman s crusade peter ekman johnson s russia list and an unsubtantiated groping allegation in november 2000 in issue 23 of the exile matt taibbi published a press review entitled peter ekman groped me the article ridiculed ekman then newly appointed editor of the moscow times for his approach to the economic and political development of russia taibbi characterized this approach as high handed condescending and arrogant and went on to mock ekman personally as a pompous hypocrite ekman has only one idea russia has a lot to learn from america which he tries endlessly to sell and resell as a varied package of ribald wit and insight the article also ridiculed ekman for describing himself as a financial educator and described him as having a head seemingly worn bald from improper use as a finishing touch taibbi recounted an as yet unverified account of sexual advances made by ekman to an exile employee made at late at night at the garazh nightclub in moscow during a visit from ekman s mother in law ekman responded by writing in to johnson s russia list to claim that the exile is fascist and racist that every exile issue contains unverifiable stories that smear someone s reputation that the exile is associated with the fascist party of eduard limonov the accusations of fascism were discounted by many in part because of the exile s jewish roots ames along with the exile s publisher deputy editor and several contributors are all jews and because of the paper s satirical editorial bent it remains unclear as to whether ekman did in fact make advances toward an exile employee or who that employee may have been old stuff \n",

      "000  new louisville definition since the census bureau has clearly defined the new louisville as only the old city and unincorporated areas i think there some details needed that need to be added defining metro government first it is important to note that a ky legislative bill dubbed the lyndon bill prohibits suburban cities from annexing more land if this were not the case then the unincorp areas could create their own government and only the old city would again be left second this definition won t effect the new city s population growth since nearly all growth is in the unicorpirated areas and nearly all suburban cities are having very slow growth or even populatiuon losses third even if suburban cities don t count toward the population their residents can still vote for metro mayor and council members and will still receive metrowide help in such areas as urban planning and emergency services personally i think the official municipality the entire county is what should make up this article regardless of what the census bureau says the smaller article with the balance is what should have the information for the census defined city your ideas of what the census bureau has defined are not correct what you are referring to is the louisville jefferson county balance which is not the same thing as consolidated louisville jefferson county both are defined separately by the census bureau see here this article is about the consolidated louisville jefferson county which is how the city is legally incorporated the confusion lies in the census bureau s use of balance figures when ranking cities rather than the consolidated figures although even this use is inconsistant as they seem to use the full consolidated figures for the decennial rankings the census bureau has accepted the louisville jefferson balance but not the city county consolidation which is why the suburban populations are not counted in its estimates and won t be in future censuses because of the acceptence of the lou jef balance my points should be brought up about the ban on suburban city annexation if this were not the case then the balance could be quickly eaten up by the suburbs your assertion is not entirely correct the census bureau does in fact include the entire consolidated louisville jefferson county in their estimates they also include a separate figure for the balance 170 louisville jefferson county kentucky a 693604 693872 694757 695843 698059 698903 699827 162 louisville jefferson county balance kentucky a 551183 551390 552058 552828 554381 555366 556429 that s from the 2005 estimates the last number is the 2005 estimated population this article is not about the balance however issues involving the balance should be discussed on the balance article s talk page actual population there are too many disputes about the population of the actual city proper according to the census bureau estimates the balance population is 556 429 and not anywhere near 700 000 what is the actual city proper population as that is to be what is listed i do not believe that louisville has a population anywhere near that of columbus ohio we need to decide the official population of the city proper and correct any and all inaccurate statements regarding the actual population there are several pages in wikipedia listing the population as 699 000 or so when the census lists the population as 556 429 i understand that several people especially those who live in the area want the population figure to be high so the city can reach a higher status if it was a city i lived in i would like to do the same however that cannot be done here an actual correct population for the city proper and the metro needs to be listed if we are able to we need to come up with the balance population of the counties and the actual city i am a little confused myself and i did not want to attempt to change anything before it is discussed there have been many people who have debated this over and over again and we have come to the consensus that is now demonstrated in the article please for the sake of your own knowledge read all the talk archives that cover this situation since there is a consensus that s currently overwhelmingly not in your favor you might want to do that research before thinking about flaming things up user stevietheman \n",

      "000  first you are misreading what your first source is the document you reference is a un interum report on resolution 425 425 dates back to 1978 that document the report does not reflect any agreement between the un and israel 425 calls for many things but there had been no public pledge from israel on dismantling the sla in fact israel in public had been saying the opposite they were not planning to leave until early july the report being issued on the 22nd isn t very meaningful its coincidence there was a whole series of meetings between the sla see later material and un various countries that was a whole lot more damaging than the interium erport on 425 second i think its better to deal with charbel barakat s fuller and more accurate version of what happened in may from his congressional testimony in june 2000 during the month of may 2000 our people remitted a memorandum to the office of the united nations in nakura in south lebanon offering suggestions to avoid bloodshed and exodus during the same month delegations representing our community met with diplomats of the us uk and french embassies in israel and at the united nations and on may 18 our representatives met with the office of the secretary general of the united nations in new york instead of taking our demands for protection on our land seriously the united nations declined to assist us the united states uk and france dismissed our fears and insisted on guarantees which were allegedly granted by the beirut regime the state of israel only prepared for our potential exodus ruling out our determination to remain on our land and defend ourselves despite the abandonment by the international community and against all odds our people decided to remain and fight for their land and rights while calling endlessly on the un to deploy its units around our villages on may 22 2000 and as israeli units were implementing their own withdrawal and the commander of the sla was absent in france the mostly shiite sector of the security zone collapsed it appeared that shiite officers were told by the israelis that they must leave before the borders closed even after the invasion of hizbollah of this area the mostly christian druse eastern enclave and the christian western enclave decided to defend themselves and protect their citizens after israel s withdrawal on may 23 2000 at 8 pm sla officers in the western sector received orders from the israelis to leave their posts as hizbollah was advancing towards their villages thus the sla was imploded from the inside and was dismantled without any battle the main reason why the sla did not remain and fight was the fact that the border was closed behind its back without access to medical and logistical supplies our people was condemned either to surrender to its enemy or flee across the border from www 10452lccc com special 20studies barakatjune2000 htm the sla did collapse what charbel barakat is talking about in the mef comments is that the remainder of the sla christian in the west did not collapse and was dismanted by israel but it was only dismanted after most of the sla had collapsed charbel barakat and other dead enders may have wanted in theory anyway to fight on in the west but israel wasn t going to make any commitment to keep a miniture version of the sla going in a tiny pocket on the west end of the border the caution i would give about barakat and a couple others from the sla is that sometimes they think of their christian portion of the sla as if it were the entire sla and from that point of view the sla did not collapse and was dismantled by israel the biggest claim made by barakat is in weasel words it appeared that shiite officers were told by the israelis that they must leave it appeared that means he is guessing nobody on either side of the border has outright claimed that the shites were told to leave and that is why they collapsed on the 22nd even barakat is unwilling to make that claim now lots of other things may have happened that the public doesn t know about with regard to the sla collapse but the only people who would know the truth are a handful of people at the top of the israeli government and army nobody in the sla knows much of anything because if israel was going to collapse them they would hardly tell them their plan people including me can make lots of hunches and theories about what might have happened but there are no facts to back any of those theories up \n",

      "000  talk well we should include both names i think it is quite likely that vlachs refer to themselves as vlachs when dealing with serbs since this is the term that serbs generally refer to them but that in their own communities they are rom ni and that they do not declare romanian on the census either because they see themselves as separate from the romanian nation state or because the believe that vlach is the name of their ethnicity in serbia in the same way that roma may declare themselves gypsies the first option is more likely i agree that we should include both names i know that some vlachs refer to themselves as rumani in their language but i am not sure that all of them use this name for themselves it would be the best that we know names which vlachs use for themselves in their own language dialect i read that vlach language even had its own script based on the greek script some 200 300 years ago but today vlach have no written form and vlachs use either standard romanian either serbian for writing talk without a doubt in their own tongue the vlachs say they speak romanian rumanesce there is no such thing as vlahesce whether the vlachs are romanian is essentially a political not an ethnic question ethnically they are romanian however they have lived for two centuries under serbian rule during this time they lost religious services and schooling in their own language which many used to have before 1830 the serbian government and serbian orthodox church have been applying a systematic and unrelenting program of assimilation for vlachs romanian personal names were forbidden by the orthodox church and this prohibition continues to this day last names family names were created by edict in the late 19th century throughout serbia since they didn t exist before all last names had to take the form ending in ic usually using the father s name as the root for most vlachs this concealed their non serb origin though certain glaring exceptions continue for example floric jepurovic st a ngacilovic etc the majority of vlachs some 300 000 do not consider themselves romanian but serbian to a large extent this is because they do not wish to be seen as unpatriotic or disloyal in addition since they have no education in their own tongue many believe that modern culture cannot be expressed in their native tongue it is meaningless to point to official serbian statistics about the vlach tongue or the number of vlach speakers too many vlachs suffer from the stockholm syndrome http en wikipedia org wiki stockholm syndrome code why is iso code none iso 639 code none ethnologue code none constantly deleted i see no objection in having this text as above because if there isn t any iso iso 639 and ethnologue code what s the point of mentioning it chinese term ni hao the chinese word lu m n y y means romanian not vlach and i don t see what the point of linking it here is vlachs are not a recognised ethnic group in china and the vlach language of serbia is not spoken there significantly if at all thanks the chinese word was added as part of a revert edit war as u can see in the history of the article seems ridiculous to be there but before removing it consider which name u will write first the uncited alleged name they are said to use or the official name the serbian state uses it s about as ridiculous as the rum nesce rum ne te in their own designation we don t know that s their own designation we could have the designations by which the romanians call them they certainly are relevant but we don t know what they call themselves greier s pov pushing has no place here \n",

      "000  hi again dear yes i strongly support independence of south azerbaijan from iran if green movement could change somethings probably i would change my idea but i dont want to be under islamic rejim anymore and i support the changing of destiny of azerbaijani people and about azerbaijanis are turks or not despite you are talking about persian theory of the roots of turkish people we all know that turks started to migrate here circa 1000 ad when saljuk turks of west branch oghuz started to come but infact it is not important when they came here the important thing is every one in azerbaijan feel themselves as azerbaijani and not azeri which is an invented word by persians turks and believe that they r turks and speak turkish lang as same as turks of turkey you can come here and ask yourself one by one you will see it is so irrarational to say to some one that no you r not turk you dont know who you are i know you r azeri and azeris are indoeuropean pls dont tell us who we r let us to identify ourselves and we identify ourselves as a turk whatever others like or not about aran as i know we didnt have eyalat aran in the qajar era we had eyalat azarbaijan and both azerbaijan rep and armenia was part of this big eyalat as well as south azerbaijan aran was part of this big land but the important thing is the name of land is not important here as well the important thing is the people who live in azerbaijan rep former aran as you called are of my race and we r same nation you may call there azerbaijan or aran but the important thing is here a nation live which called themselves azerbaijani turks you may call them whatever you want as well as their land the important thing is what they call themselves if they change the name of their republic will you satisfy what about next will you ask them to call themselves arani and start to speak aranian language which does not exist ok let s think azerbaijanis r not turk so what they r azeri ok let s call them azeri what is the next step you will ask them to forget to speak in turkish language and start to speak persian or not speak azeri lang so what is azeri lang where is it can you learn it to about 32 million people let s thing pragmatic as well as rational even if your theory of roots of this people is correct historically you cant ask them to speak neither a lang of 1000 years ago nor persian also i dont rely neither to researches of kasravi nor zehtabi cos both were under some believes of their backgrounds and governments one was paniranist other was panturkist some of their researches looks really funny about the names of turkish places and cities i guess you have never ever travell to azerbaijan if you were here you ll see that iranian government has changed the names during pahlavi era some of them are such a funny thing that r jokes between us for example tabriz has a suburb in western part of the city called akhmagaya which in turkish means the rock which falling down and it is a rocky place do u know what is its official name ahmagiyyeh the lands of stupid people all of the turkish names tried to change to a persian words which looks verbally simmilar them the fact is persian never have been to azerbaijan most of the azerbaijani names have armenian or tat roots not persian my believe is that a mixture of differnet natios like tats armenians and other caucasian tribes lived here and then turkish tribes of western branch have migrated to this land in large size and get married with the native people and has made the new nation which called azerbaijani turks nowadays they have their own culture music dance cuisine etc which seperate them form persians and interestingly this culture is like culture of turks of anatolia which believes that they r 100 percent turk i told you history is not important than today the important thing is every one here feel themselves as a turk i dont know what they want us to feel in tehran the name of azar abade gan looks wrong as well this word cant change to azarbaijan during history i guess the word was azar pay gan maybe which zoroastrian persians called not azar abad gan which ferdowsi mentioned in shahnameh and everyone got to accept it now i had a look to your files about vote frauding which i still believe is correct as well the diagrams of those pdf pages show that people of iran will give their votes to ahmadinezhad when that company asked them before election but you know there is unwrittenable rules in iran which every one know whenever some one come and ask me in person that do u like islamic republic ali khameni and bla bla bla i will answer yes cos i dont want to lose my life we dont have life guaranty\n",

      "000  a few suggestions on measuring economic worth over time i fully realize that this is a work in progress but thought a few suggestions could be useful i ll post some specific ones on the talk page but more generally please don t take it the wrong way but i think quite often your writing style reflects academia too much as if you were writing for an academic journal however the intended target audience of the wikipedia is different than that of a bunch of academics so care should be taken to avoid unnecessary nomenclature and jargon as well as to avoid academic phrasing in favor of simple formulations more importantly i think one should be careful with introducing terms and concepts into the text that have not been defined previously and that a lay reader may be unfamiliar with for example social cost or social production speaking of social production it d be useful to standardize the terminology when it is being used for example it seems like by proportions of social production you refer to income shares of various classes workers capitalists landlords etc if so then that should be stated clearly if not the difference should be clarified likewise comparing the article title and the lead i think you re equivocating between economic worth and social worth which could be are distinct concepts also because i m probably coming at this from a different background i m wondering what exactly is the relationship between social product and more standard measures of production like gdp income etc both contemporary and historical wage price series are inherently controversial as they speak to the standard of living of working class people i m not sure if contemporary wage and price series are really inherently controversial in the sense of being outright rejected by many researchers at least that doesn t seem like the appropriate word here likewise i don t think the reason why they are controversial deemed important is because they concern working class people they obviously concern all members of society whatever their class status in a similar way the idea of economic worth can refer to entities such as firms charities nations or even physical objects such as machinery and equipment proportion of gdp and the questions given as examples aren t really related for example the question what was the opportunity cost of a 50 000 investment in 1840 is not obviously or directly related to the question what was the social power of capital in 1840 some ideas for expansion theoretical problems sections should link and perhaps briefly mention things like the ltv and marginalism maybe something like the aggregation problem though that article needs some serious work wage price series can be expanded to include discussion of how these kind of data are generally collected btw i m not sure what a real price is here an individual good price divided by a price index for historical wage price series there s also a good bit of data available for the netherlands and to a lesser extent france and germany there s also sporadic data for a wide number of different societies which don t really constitute a series but do provide snapshot views of the economy society in time all the way back to ancient sumer the main difficulty of comparing aggregates across time is the changing nature of a consumption basket and time usage in particular introduction of new goods and disappearance of old ones like malleus alludes to above this should also be elaborated upon and made more explicit i d really hate to barge in and edit a new article while it is still being written so i thought bringing up some suggestions here would be better thanks \n",

      "000 toward a better description of the collapse of the sla there is lots of detail missing in the account of the collapse of the sla the idf according to its plan of withdrawal started handing major positions in lebanon over to the sla in the middle of may 2000 the collapse started on may 22 2000 around a dozen villages and eight sla posts in the center of the front surrendered to hezbollah the posts were mostly manned by shiite muslims who were put under heavy pressure by hezbollah hezbollah had made pubic threats against those involved with the sla in april 2000 the threats were most effective against the shites in the sla antoine lahad the leader of the sla was in paris while all of this was going on lahad s departure for france at such a critical time was a source of demoralization within the sla lahad has claimed that he was taking an extended family vacation in advance of the july departure of the idf he claims to not have been aware of the handover of idf positions to the sla in may by the end of the day the sla front line had been cut in two with the flanks of the sla positions in both the east and the west totally exposed to attack on the morning of may 23 2000 the western druze sector of the front collapsed there were in 2000 reports of a secret deal between walid jumblatt and hezbollah that led to the collapse this triggered off a general retreat of what remained of the sla shortly after both israelis and some elements of the sla were moving south the retreat was finished by the early hours of may 24 israeli initially announced that it would give labor visas good for one year to soldiers of the sla the controversy in all this is what the israelis really intended to do in may many senior figures in the sla claim that israel announced the july departure date while actually planning a full withdrawal from lebanon in may 2000 these sla people claim that israel deliberately did not tell them the depature date because of fears the lebanese could not be trusted with the information i dont tend to believe these sorts of stories my view is that the sla collapsed out of its own internal weakness the sla was really multiple religious militias with no effective unified command to speak of hezbollah worked on breaking off the shite and druze elements of the sla the shite portion cut a deal first the druze portion seeing that the game was up closed their own deal after lahad probably knew what was going to happen and stayed far away i think most of what i ve wrote can be sourced with newspaper articles from the time may 2000 i ve put this on the discussion page for informational purposes rather than the article itself because all of this would be very controversial maybe someday someone can rewrite the section of the article on the sla collapse \n",

      "000  canada in canada following consultation with all major religious groups the divorce act was amended in 1985 to add section 21 1 to give the courts have the power to dismiss any application and strike out any pleadings and affidavits filed by a spouse who has failed to remove religious barriers to the remarriage of the other spouse the legislature intended to place spouses on a more equal footing in civil divorce actions encourage women in particular to exercise fully their rights under the law and maintain the integrity of the divorce act 1985 by helping to ensure that refusing to accept or to give a religious divorce was not used as a bargaining tool to gain unfair concessions on child custody and access or monetary support this reflects a general strong response at a federal level to any elements of duress or undue influence within the civil law system bruker v marcovitz the justiciability of a civil contract with religious overtonese is now being tested in the supreme court case of bruker v marcovitz see canadian civil liberties association http www ccla org pos legal in 1969 the parties married in an orthodox ceremony during the next 11 years they adopted two children after ms bruker was unable to conceive in april of 1980 ms bruker initiated divorce proceedings a link to the decision database is http www jugements qc ca and the full decision can be found with a text search for bruker under cour d appel in 1980 mr marcovitz agreed upon a consent judgment for the divorce to appear immediately before rabbinical authorities for the purpose of granting the religious get shortly after the civil divorce ms bruker personally and through various attorneys and rabbis asked mr marcovitz to provide the get but mr marcovitz refused mr marcovitz opined that he refused to comply because he viewed ms bruker s behavior since the divorce as harassment and an attempt by her to alienate him from his children ms bruker sued mr marcovitz in 1989 seeking damages in the amount of 500 000 for having been restrained from going on with her life since de decree nisi for having been restrained to remarry according to the jewish faith and for having been restricted of having children marcovitz vs bruker 500 09 013353 032 september 20 2005 in 1995 a certificate of divorce was issued by the rabbinical court of montreal with mr marcovitz s consent and participation to the get despite receiving the get ms bruker amended her action to increase the amount of the damages claimed to 1 350 000 and to include damages for the loss of consortium since mr marcovitz was in breach of a judgment of the civil court the lower court found that the matter could be argued before the civil courts and that mr marcovitz had breached his contractual obligation to appear before rabbinical authorities he awarded ms bruker 47 500 in damages on appeal justice hilton writing for the three member court overturned the lower court judgement the appellate court ruled that the obligation was religious in nature and so could not be judged by the civil courts it matters not that the obligation was stated in the consent that the superior court ratified since the superior court could never have entertained an application for corollary relief under section 17 of the divorce act to require the issuance of a ghet it is not at all unusual to see the parties in an agreement on corollary relief undertake to perform a variety of obligations that are not strictly speaking obtainable independently but which are desirable nevertheless to the extent that they promote an amicable post divorce environment while i recognize the usefulness of the inclusion of obligations of this nature in divorce agreements it does not follow that they all automatically become subject to curial supervision and control whether for specific performance or damages in the event of a breach in my view in order for such clauses to be enforceable they must be directly related to one of the subje\n",
